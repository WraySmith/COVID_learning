That includes two more patients believed to have contracted the disease through community transmission — they don't have a recent history of travel and haven't had any contact with known infected people. The new cases also include two health-care workers at Lynn Valley Care Centre, which has experienced an outbreak of novel coronavirus. The remaining three cases have been traced to travel overseas. Coast Meridian Elementary School in Surrey, B.C., is closed as a precaution after the district was informed a member of the school community may have tested positive for COVID-19. A statement said school officials had been ""unable"" to confirm the positive test with health authorities, but decided to close the school Wednesday for deep cleaning out of ""significant caution."" A Catholic elementary school in Vancouver, St. Francis of Assisi, is closed for the remainder of the week through spring break after its principal was notified a parent had tested positive for COVID-19. A private high school linked to the elementary school, Notre Dame Regional Secondary School, is also closed because staff and students had recently contacted younger students from St. Francis of Assisi. A statement from Catholic Independent Schools Vancouver Archdiocese said the risk to the school community is low and the closures are proactive. The Surrey Women in Business Awards have also been cancelled. The Surrey Board of Trade announced Wednesday all of its March events, including the awards ceremony, were to be postponed or cancelled. Rogers has cancelled the Hometown Hockey Tour, including upcoming stops in North Vancouver and Campbell River.  B.C. has now identified a total 39 COVID-19 patients, including one elderly man who has died. Meanwhile, officials are bracing for the impact on B.C.'s health-care system and economy as the virus continues to spread.  Henry is expected to provide another update on coronavirus on Wednesday afternoon. Important reminders: B.C.'s top doctor, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said the risk of contracting coronavirus in B.C. communities remains low. Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. In Canada, public health officials have reported a total of 94 cases.  The Public Health Agency of Canada, which has been assessing risk as the global outbreak progresses, has said the risk is low in Canada. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said on Twitter that ""people over 65 years of age and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing severe disease."" She advised that those more vulnerable people should avoid cruise ships, international conferences and other large indoor gatherings. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Common symptoms include: But more serious symptoms can develop, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia. What should I do if I feel sick? Stay home.

She is also calling for the cancellation of gatherings of more than 250 people. The new stringent measures came with the announcement of seven new cases of of COVID-19 in B.C., bringing the total to 53 confirmed cases across the province including a second outbreak at a care centre on Vancouver's North Shore.   Hollyburn House, in West Vancouver, has confirmed two cases of COVID-19: a resident and an employee. Both are isolated and being treated. A statement from the home said the employee's case was detected through the centre's screening process, which had been in effect since the weekend. Health officials have now taken the ""extraordinary"" measure of calling recently retired doctors in the province, asking if they'd be willing and available to come back to work if the current health-care system becomes overwhelmed by COVID-19. Two more people who tested postive with COVID-19 have now recovered and are no longer believed to be infectious.  Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is warning people who were at the Pacific Dental Conference in Vancouver on March 6 that one of the attendees has tested positive for COVID-19. More than 14,000 people attended the conference. VCH said the risk to other participants is extremely low and the infected patient is now recovering at home. Several major events across the Lower Mainland have been cancelled or postponed, including the annual Vaisakhi parade in Surrey which typically draws 500,000 people and the Vancouver Sun Run.  Dr. Henry is asking British Columbians to practise social distancing by not getting closer to others than what's necessary. Meanwhile, B.C. faith leaders have been told to keep their services and group gatherings limited.  Nationally, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife are in self-isolation over COVID-19 concerns, the prime minister's office announced Thursday morning. Sophie Grégoire Trudeau began showing flu-like symptoms after returning from a trip to the United Kingdom. The prime minister is not experiencing symptoms, but has decided to self-isolate and work from home out of an abundance of caution while his wife's test results are processed. The coronavirus outbreak is now being called a pandemic as of Wednesday, the WHO said, as the number of people infected rose to more than 118,000 in 114 countries, with 4,291 deaths. In the United States, President Donald Trump announced a European travel ban, along with financial relief for affected workers. The pandemic showed signs of hurting the entertainment industry, as actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson revealed they have tested positive for COVID-19 while shooting a movie in Australia. This weekend's Juno Awards show in Saskatoon has been cancelled, while, in Vancouver, production of the TV show Riverdale was suspended after someone on the set came into contact with a coronavirus patient. And the NBA announced it is postponing all games after a Utah Jazz player was diagnosed with COVID-19.

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said on Twitter that outbreak control measures are meant to slow the spread of the disease, reduce the impact on the health-care system and give hospitals time to prepare. That means that everyone needs to practise good hygiene and protect older people and those with weakened immune systems from exposure. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) says testing is currently available for people who have a history of travel to regions affected by COVID-19 and symptoms typical of an infection. Affected areas include Mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. To find out if you can be tested, contact your health-care provider or call HealthLink BC at 811 to talk to a nurse and get advice.

That includes an outbreak at Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver, where three administrative staff members have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Five of the new cases announced Friday are related to travel to Iran, Egypt, the Philippines and Mexico, and one has been linked to the ongoing outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. All new cases are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Right now, two of B.C.'s COVID-19 patients are being treated in hospital. One man in his 80s has died. The affected staff at Lions Gate have not worked in clinical areas at the hospital, but out of caution, visitor access has been restricted to patients' family members only. Patient access is unrestricted. On Thursday, provincial and federal officials took the most wide-ranging measures to prevent the spread of the virus since the novel coronavirus outbreak began. British Columbians are being asked to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Any B.C. resident who does travel abroad is asked to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. Canada's top doctor echoed the warning on a national level on Friday, advising all Canadians to cancel any travel outside of Canada. Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau said Friday cruise ships carrying more than 500 people will not be allowed to dock in Canada until July 1, slashing the economy-boosting cruise ship seasons in Victoria and Metro Vancouver by half. The Greater Victoria Harbour Authority said Friday the local economy is set to take a $70-million hit as a result of the cancellations. Henry also recommended cancelling any gatherings of more than 250 people. Health-care officials have asked residents to start social distancing — not getting close to other people, aside from what is necessary — to lessen the chance of the novel coronavirus spreading through large groups at once. Faith leaders have been told to keep their services to fewer than 1,000 people and limit physical conduct. The Canadian Council of Imams and the Muslim Medical Association of Canada recommended Friday that services be suspended indefinitely, including today. The University of British Columbia has cancelled classes with 250 students or more until virtual alternatives are in place. The City of Vancouver is cancelling all events with more than 250 people but says tickets will be reimbursed if already purchased. Community centres, libraries and fitness centres are still open but undergoing enhanced cleaning. Saunas and steam rooms will be closed and some facilities like the swimming pools at Hillcrest Centre and Killarney Community Centre will have limited access to make sure numbers don't swell past 250.  The city says its emergency operation centre has been running since Monday and plans are underway to maintain services for the most vulnerable people, including services for the homeless community.  Many school districts across B.C. will begin their two-week spring break on Friday.  B.C. Education Minister Rob Fleming said Thursday the ministry has not considered extending spring break due to COVID-19 because risk in schools remains low. Many parents in B.C. were calling for schools to be shut down, particularly after the Ontario government announced it is closing all its publicly funded schools for two weeks following spring break to slow the spread of the virus. B.C. Education Min. Rob Fleming says the ministry hasn't considered extending spring break due to <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#COVID19</a> because risk in schools remains low. But says the break's arrival is well timed. <a href=""https://twitter.com/cbcnewsbc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@cbcnewsbc</a> <a href=""https://t.co/dLRw6MDcky"">pic.twitter.com/dLRw6MDcky</a> Parliament was suspended on Friday. Conservative House Leader Mark Strahl said all parties have agreed to adjourn the House of Commons for at least five weeks while allowing the government to spend money to respond to the pandemic.  NDP House Leader Peter Julian said politicians are uniting across party lines to lead by example, avoiding a large gathering of people. Late Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, had tested positive for COVID-19. She is in isolation and feeling well, with mild symptoms. The prime minister said he was in good health with no symptoms, but will stay in isolation for 14 days and hold meetings by telephone or videoconferencing at the advice of his doctor. The prime minister's office said Grégoire Trudeau began showing flu-like symptoms after returning from a trip to the United Kingdom. Henry, the health officer, announced an outbreak on Thursday at a second care home on Vancouver's North Shore. Three patients linked to Hollyburn House in West Vancouver: one is a resident in his 90s and the other two are health-care workers who are also connected to an outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. The other new cases announced Thursday included three linked to travel to the U.K. or Egypt and one apparent case of community transmission that is under investigation.

Health Minister Adrian Dix provided an update on the novel coronavirus at noon, announcing nine new cases bumping the total number of cases in the province to 73. It also provided new details about B.C.'s testing measures and discouraged people from stockpiling supplies. The province has a new testing strategy which will focus primarily on health-care workers, those who are already in hospital and people in long-term care homes. Those returning to Canada from international travel will not be tested, even if they show mild symptoms. The Ministry of Health as directed anyone coming from outside the country to stay at home and self-isolate for 14-days. Canadians have been advised to cancel all non-essential travel outside of the country, and on Saturday, Minister of Foreign Affairs François-Philippe Champagne advised all Canadians currently abroad to return to Canada ""via commercial means while they remain available."" This is a step up from the previous directive which encouraged travellers to think about returning  and led to a scramble at airports around the world.  Health-care officials have asked residents to start social distancing — not getting closer to other people, aside from what is necessary — to lessen the chance of the novel coronavirus spreading through large groups at once. On Friday, Dr. Henry took the additional step making an order banning all public gatherings of more than 250 people. Vancouver Coastal Health announced that visitors to all its facilities would be restricted to family members. On Saturday, BC Ferries cancelled a number of sailings departing Swartz bay and Tsawwassen ""to meet current service demands."" Two sailings are also cancelled on Monday.  Also on Saturday, the owner of Whistler Blackcomb — Vail Resorts — announced it will close all 37 of its resorts around the world for eight days beginning Sunday to reassess its approach to guest and employee safety amid coronavirus. But with Saturday marking the start of spring break for many B.C. families, there are still plenty of things to do in the age of social distancing.  B.C.'s major universities are now making the switch to online classes for the rest of the term, and B.C. Supreme Court has cancelled all jury selections until the end of May. B.C. has now identified a total of 73 COVID-19 patients, including one man in his 80s who died.

Although a North Vancouver man in his 80s became the first — and so far, only — COVID-19 related death Monday, six people have since fully recovered.  B.C.'s cases now span every regional health authority in the province, with the majority of patients undergoing self-isolation at home with mild symptoms.  Officials are focusing on the three outbreak centres: the Lions Gate Hospital and the Lynn Valley Care Centre facility in North Vancouver, as well as Hollyburn House in West Vancouver.  Testing is now being streamlined to focus on outbreak clusters, healthcare workers, those in hospital, and people in long-term care homes. Travellers who have been outside the country do not need to be tested even if they show mild symptoms, says Dr. Bonnie Henry, but they are asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days.  But some were scrambling to actually make it back home. On Sunday Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne again recommended Canadian travellers return to Canada via commercial means ""while they remain available.""  He also said on Sunday that Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair and Minister of Transport Marc Garneau would be announcing new borders and airport measures soon. In the meantime, social distancing measures are being encouraged across the province and Dr. Henry issued a public health order Friday against gatherings of over 250 people.  Great Canadian Gaming, which operates 10 casinos in B.C., has announced that it is suspending all operations at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. Also on Sunday, the City of Surrey said it is closing all recreation centres, ice rinks, pools and libraries to prevent spread of the virus. Delta will do the same on Monday, while West Vancouver will shutter similar municipal facilities at 8 p.m. PT Monday. BC Hydro said on Sunday that it would cancel all non-emergency planned power outages for the coming week as people are spending more time in their homes. Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said Sunday that more non-essential programs and services would be cancelled over the coming week. ""My top priority right now is to ensure we do what we can to slow or stop the spread of the virus and to make sure our most vulnerable neighbours are safe, especially seniors, those living in SROs or who are experiencing homelessness,"" he said in a release. Many popular events and activities have been cancelled or shut down to prevent the possible spread of the virus, including a week-long closure of Whistler Blackcomb. Cypress Mountain Resort announced it will suspend operations on Sunday at 4 p.m. given concerns around the virus.  ""We have worked tirelessly over the past couple of weeks to increase preventative measures in order to reduce the possibility of transmission of the coronavirus, but ultimately we feel the appropriate step right now is to be socially [responsible],"" says a statement on the resort website. Capilano University and Langara College have both announced that all in-person classes on Monday and Tuesday are suspended as the schools transition to online courses, which will begin on Wednesday. Metro Vancouver's Douglas College, which has 25,000 students, said it would be open for classes Monday. It is making plans to stop in-person classes, which will be implemented no later than March 20. BC Ferries is cutting service Sunday and Monday between Tsawassen and Swartz Bay, citing lower demand. Four sailings in either direction will be cut Sunday including the noon, 2 p.m., 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. On Saturday, Vancouver Coastal Health announced that visitors to all its facilities would be restricted to family members. Fraser Health is also limiting the number of visitors to its hospitals. In neighbouring Washington state, 40 have died and more than 550 have been infected. Officials said the disease is straining the supply of protective gear available to medical providers despite shipments from the federal government.

Henry said the three deaths, in addition to the first on March 8, occurred among residents of the Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. The care home has grappled with an outbreak of the virus that infected a cluster of patients and staff in recent weeks. The province confirmed 30 more cases of COVID-19 over the weekend, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 103. All levels of government in B.C. are now taking some of the most sweeping steps to date to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus through the province, asking British Columbians to cancel gatherings of more than 50 people. Citizens are also being asked to stay home when they can, while officials directed every hospital in the province to prepare for an influx of patients and ask municipalities to close non-essential community hubs. B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said the ministry has asked all hospitals in the province to move to an outbreak response phase, meaning all non-urgent scheduled surgeries will be postponed to free up ""hundreds and hundreds and hundreds"" of hospital beds, as the health-care system braces for more patients. The provincial measures came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada is closing its borders to most people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Air crews, diplomats and immediately family members of Canadians are exceptions to the closure. U.S. citizens are also exempt from the restrictions, a decision that disappointed B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix, who advised Americans simply: ""Don't come."" The federal government is mandating air carriers screen passengers with symptoms of the novel coronavirus out of lines so they don't board planes home, Trudeau said Monday morning. Ottawa is also restricting international flights to just four airports across the country, one of which being Vancouver International Airport. The prime minister said the country is taking ""increasingly aggressive steps'' to keep everyone safe in an ""exceptional"" time. Close to home, the social landscape in many B.C. communities has changed to encourage social distancing, a public health practice of avoiding crowds and large gatherings that can slow the spread of a virus. Health officials across the country say this will ease the burden on the health-care system over time — an intervention known as ""flattening the curve."" Surrey, Vancouver, West Vancouver, Port Coquitlam and Delta are among the cities closing all recreation centres, ice rinks, pools, libraries and cultural centres as of Monday. Major events have been cancelled, businesses are closing, storefronts and residents are asked to avoid bars or restaurants with more than 50 people packed inside. The Vancouver Art Gallery is now closed to the public indefinitely, and Vancouver's mayor has advised citizens to avoid bars and restaurants if they can't ensure a distance of at least one metre apart.  Mayor Kennedy Stewart has also ordered all bars and restaurants in the downtown core to close on March 17, to avoid large crowds celebrating St. Patrick's Day. And the four breweries who make up Port Moody's beloved Brewer's Row said they would be closing their tasting rooms for the time being, although facilities would be open to fill growlers and for off-sales.  Both Grouse Mountain and Mount Seymour also announced the suspension of operations. Crown corporations are also changing the way they run: BC Ferries is cutting service between Tsawwassen and Swartz Bay on Monday, citing lower demand, while BC Hydro will cancel all non-emergency planned power outages for the coming week to accommodate people spending more time at home. B.C. Provincial Court is reducing operations as of Monday, cancelling conferences for family, child protection and small claims cases through May 4. Bail hearings will only be done virtually, unless a judge or justice orders otherwise. The B.C. Supreme Court announced the cancellation of jury selection and said trials with juries would either proceed by judge alone or face adjournment. The B.C. Court of Appeal asked parties to adjourn hearings and federal court proceedings were also cancelled. A number of other universities and colleges, such as Simon Fraser University and Douglas College, are moving to virtual learning for their students. The University of British Columbia announced plans to transition to online classes for the remainder of the term. Younger students in B.C. begin their first full week of March Break on Monday — a well-timed reprieve for health-care officials who had been contemplating whether to close schools earlier this month, but a stressor for parents deciding how to entertain their children at home. B.C. and Manitoba are now the only provinces in Canada that have not closed schools amid the pandemic. Henry said she expected to make an announcement related to schools sometime Tuesday. Henry said that only six of the patients who have been confirmed are in hospital. Five patients are considered to be fully recovered. B.C.'s cases now span every regional health authority in the province, with the majority of patients undergoing self-isolation at home with mild symptoms. The latest cases are linked to the Pacific Dental Conference in Vancouver, which saw 15,000 people attend on March 6-7. Anyone who attended has been asked to self-isolate. Officials in B.C. have identified three outbreak centres on the North Shore: Lions Gate Hospital and the Lynn Valley Care Centre facility in North Vancouver, as well as Hollyburn House in West Vancouver.  On Monday, Henry said there have been no further cases confirmed at Hollyburn House. There are at least 673 cases in neighbouring Washington state, including 42 deaths. The border closure announced by the federal government Monday does not apply to travellers from the U.S. The prime minister said the U.S. is not included in the ban ""at the moment"" because the relationship between the Canadian and American economies is delicate, adding the situation is still going to be examined ""in coming days."" On Monday, B.C.'s health minister said he was concerned by the U.S. exemption. He urged visitors from Washington state — particularly those from King County and Snohomish County — to not visit Canada, given the severity of the stateside outbreak. Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, urged everyone to take measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, making sure elderly and vulnerable members of the community are protected and supported. That means cancelling non-essential international travel, avoiding crowds, working from home if possible, and staying two arms' lengths from others. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) said on Twitter on Monday it is adding additional screening measures at all international airports, in wake of criticism over lax screening over the weekend. Further, the prime minister said Monday international flights will now only be accepted at four airports in the country -- one of which is Vancouver International Airport. Important reminders: B.C.'s top doctor, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said the risk of contracting coronavirus in B.C. communities remains low. Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face. The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. In Canada, public health officials have reported at least 421 confirmed or presumptive cases.  The Public Health Agency of Canada, which has been assessing risk as the global outbreak progresses, has said the risk remains low in Canada.  What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

2020-03-18T01:40:20.123Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-update-bc-what-you-need-to-know-march-17-1.5499835,"The province of British Columbia declared a public health emergency Tuesday after 83 new cases were confirmed and three more people died of COVID-19. The province has now identified a total of 186 patients, seven of whom have died. Provincial Medical Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the emergency declaration will give her the ability to be ""faster, more streamlined and nimble"" in carrying out her directions. It also means Henry can issue verbal orders ""with immediate effect."" And she can call on peace officers to carry out those orders. To that end, Henry has ordered all bars and nightclubs to close. Other businesses must implement measures to keep a distance of one to two metres between people. Any restaurants that can't make that happen have been told to switch to takeout only. The province's elementary and secondary schools have also been ordered to remain closed indefinitely. B.C. Education Minister Rob Fleming said the province made ""the difficult decision"" to suspend K-12 learning in order to stop the spread of COVID-19 through the education system. Fleming said ""99 per cent"" of B.C.'s 550,000 students are currently out of school until March 30, but independent schools and private schools that are still open have been told to suspend classes immediately. All students will receive final grades regardless of the shutdown, and those set to move onto the next grade this fall will still do so. At the same news conference, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the province is continuing to work on a stimulus package to help the economy during the pandemic. She said she hopes eligibility requirements for employment insurance benefits will be expanded to include more workers, such as those who are self-employed or part-time, as early as Wednesday. B.C.'s provincial court announced the closure of three courthouses Wednesday after learning that a court participant at each location had been in touch with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. The courthouses in Campbell River and Nanaimo will be closed until March 23 and the courthouse in Chilliwack will be closed indefinitely. An increasing number of British Columbians are working from home Tuesday or finding themselves out of work entirely, as employers across the province close storefronts, offices, cafes and any location where people may gather in an effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. In the bigger cities, pub chains like Cactus Club and the Donnelly Group temporarily closed their restaurants and bars, putting hundreds out of work. LNG Canada announced it is reducing the number of staff at its Kitimat site on B.C.'s North Coast by half, accounting for about 100 more jobs. All of Vancouver's restaurants, bars, lounges and similar venues were ordered to close to prevent thousands of St. Patrick's Day revellers from coming together in one area. B.C.'s tourism sector, historically one of the strongest pillars of the provincial economy, has already begun to feel the effects of a slowdown without the usual rush of springtime visitors. Regional economies in Metro Vancouver and Victoria had already been bracing for a poor tourism season after cruise ships, which had became a symbol of the pandemic after two voyages saw early outbreaks, were banned from Canadian ports until at least July 1. ""A lot of folks are saying, 'If things don't turn around soon, we're going to have to shut our doors and start laying people off,'"" Ted Lee, CEO of Tourism Vancouver, said in an interview Tuesday. ""We need help."" As of Tuesday, BC Ferries will allow passengers to stay inside their cars on the enclosed car deck to encourage social distancing and to avoid crowds on deck. Passengers are not usually permitted to stay in their cars to ensure their safety in an emergency. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control said its supply of swabs used to test for COVID-19 has become ""critically limited,"" a situation confirmed by B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix in an interview on Tuesday. Dix said testing is being further prioritized for health care workers and clusters of infection, for example, while health authorities search for more supplies and work to use other varieties of swabs. ""Every effort is being made to get more swabs,"" Dix said Tuesday. ""We have to concentrate now to control the spread of the virus on specific things."" British Columbians have been ordered to cancel all gatherings of more than 50 people. Citizens have been urged to stay home if possible, and municipalities were asked to close non-essential community hubs. In B.C., many public facilities including recreation centres, swimming pools and libraries have been closed. All B.C. hospitals are now expected to postpone non-urgent scheduled surgeries to free up hospital beds in anticipation of more COVID-19 patients. Pharmacists have been told to provide prescription refills without requiring patients to make non-essential visits to their doctors. The federal government is closing Canada's borders to most people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents as of Wednesday to slow the spread of COVID-19. Air crews, diplomats, U.S. citizens and immediate family members of Canadians will still be admitted to the country. Ottawa has mandated that airlines screen passengers with COVID-19 symptoms and not allow them to board planes back to Canada. Vancouver International Airport (YVR) says it is working to increase screening measures as it becomes one of only four Canadian airports accepting international travellers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.   The airport's CEO said travellers arriving on overseas flights will see more signs warning them about the novel coronavirus after they disembark, while Canada Border Services Agency staff and health-care staff monitor them closely for symptoms. Dix said visitors from the U.S. should not travel to the province despite the federal government's exception, particularly if they are from neighbouring Washington state, which has grappled with a serious local outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

The numbers rose on the same day that Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth declared a provincial state of emergency in B.C., to ensure provincial and federal resources are delivered jointly in an ""all hands on deck"" approach. The move, Farnworth said, will allow for the preservation of supply chains delivering groceries and other essential items to the province during the COVID-19 pandemic, though he said the province's supply of goods is currently in ""good shape."" Seven British Columbians have died of COVID-19 and 13 people have been hospitalized, seven of whom are in intensive care units. Henry said there was also a new case involving a resident of a long-term care home, the Haro Park Centre in Vancouver's West End. Farnworth said the legislature will resume sitting on Monday in order to expedite the province's response to COVID-19 ""and the key decisions that will need to be made in the coming days."" The minister said the opposition Liberals and the Green Party have agreed to resume the legislature with a reduced number of members to ensure ""the continuity of government and provide important employment supports,"" meaning all three major parties in B.C. have come together in a unified approach to manage the crisis. ""Our government will do whatever is necessary to protect and support British Columbians and communities and we'll use any and all resources to keep people safe,"" Farnworth said Wednesday. The province-wide state of emergency comes in addition to the public health emergency declared Tuesday. The B.C. government has also announced the postponement of byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton that were scheduled to take place in April, as well as a referendum that was planned for Kamloops. Wednesday brought a number of new measures from the federal government, some in partnership with the United States, to support and protect Canadians during the COVID-19 crisis. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday the federal government will spend up to $82 billion on measures to support the Canadian economy through the global pandemic. He said the funds will be a combination of $27 billion in direct supports for workers and businesses, and tax deferrals.  Trudeau also confirmed Canada and the United States have reached an unprecedented deal to close their shared border to all non-essential traffic to stem the virus's spread. The closure means recreational travellers like tourists or shoppers would be barred from entering either country. Trudeau said trade and the nation's supply chain will be unaffected. Truck freight will still be permitted. The City of Vancouver will be declaring its own state of emergency at a special virtual council meeting on Thursday. ""These are extraordinary times, and we need to take fast and extraordinary action,"" said Mayor Kennedy Stewart. The declaration means the city will have a wide variety of powers it can immediately enact, including the possibility of closing all restaurants indefinitely to in-person service. Delta Mayor George Harvie has also asked Emergency Management B.C. for the authority to declare a local state of emergency in his city, saying it would give Delta ""additional abilities to protect the community."" The chief justice of the B.C. Supreme Court sent out a statement saying all regular operations of the Supreme Court will be suspended, effective immediately, until at least the end of April. An official announcement is expected later Wednesday. On Wednesday, the decision was made to shut the provincial courthouse in Vancouver, as well as the downtown community court, until further notice. Both operate out of the same building at 222 Main St. on the edge of the Downtown Eastside. The courts are among the busiest in the province. The decision to shutter them follows the indefinite closure of the Chilliwack court on Tuesday along with the courts in Nanaimo and Campbell River. In B.C., provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry officially declared a public health emergency on Tuesday after the total number of COVID-19 patients in the province rose sharply to 186. Seven people have now died of the disease in the province, including six connected to an outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. The declaration means Henry now has the power to make verbal orders to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, and the authority to compel police to immediately enforce those orders. The reality of the public health emergency is setting in across B.C., as businesses close and streets clear out to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. All bars, nightclubs and pubs in the province have been ordered to close indefinitely, and other businesses have been told to implement social-distancing measures to keep people one or two metres apart. Any restaurant or cafe that can't achieve that has been told to offer only takeout or delivery meals. B.C.'s ban on gatherings of more than 50 people remains in effect, and people returning from any international travel have been ordered to self-isolate for 14 days. In B.C., Finance Minister Carole James said she expected employment insurance eligibility to be extended as early as Wednesday to include those who wouldn't usually qualify, such as contractors and part-time or self-employed workers. On Wednesday, Trudeau said the federal government's aid plan includes a new Emergency Care Benefit to provide income support to workers who have to stay home but don't have access to paid sick leave. The provincial government on Tuesday ordered elementary and secondary schools to cancel classes indefinitely Meanwhile, all courts in B.C. are restricting operations and some RCMP detachments are limiting their front counter service to reduce the spread of the virus. Public facilities including recreation centres, swimming pools and libraries have also been closed. The B.C. government's main message to the public is to practise vigilant hand washing, work from home if possible and maintain social distancing. The health minister and the provincial health officer demonstrated the concept of social distancing at a press conference on Tuesday. The B.C. government continues to urge members of the public not to hoard groceries and other necessities. ""There isn't any need to overstock your own supplies. Doing so will put at risk seniors, single parents and others who need those necessities,"" Finance Minister Carole James said Tuesday. Important reminders: B.C.'s top doctor, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said the risk of contracting coronavirus in B.C. communities remains low.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the number of confirmed cases has risen to 271, an increase of 40 cases from Wednesday. Seventeen of the confirmed patients are in hospital and nine of those people are in intensive care. B.C. is now under a province-wide state of emergency. The declaration was made Wednesday to give the government broad and sweeping power to compel action while preserving supply chains of groceries and other essential items in the face of COVID-19. Solicitor General Mike Farnworth said the ""all hands on deck approach"" will allow for the delivery of federal, provincial and local resources in a co-ordinated way and complement the declaration of a public health emergency in B.C. announced Tuesday. The City of Vancouver unanimously approved its own local state of emergency on Thursday. A number of other municipalities, including Delta and New Westminster, have moved to do the same. The province on Thursday announced B.C. Liquor Store hours are being reduced to protect staff. The Crown corporation is also going to begin limiting the amount of people allowed in a store at a time, where necessary. B.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson suspended the court's regular operations Thursday in order to comply with public health guidelines and contain the spread of COVID-19. Henry stressed that her orders around social distancing, self-isolation and self-quarantine are ""not optional."" The emergency declarations give Henry and the province the power to enforce her demands, and she said they have been working with law enforcement agencies to discuss implementation.  The Supreme Court will hear urgent matters by telephone or video — including orders issued under the Quarantine Act and the Public Health Act and matters involving refusal to accept treatment, civil restraining orders and urgent injunctions. Early Thursday, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Canadians worried about having enough money to pay for food, rent and medication can expect emergency funds in two to three weeks. The aid, announced Wednesday, will be delivered to applicants by direct deposit, rather than cheques in the mail. In a news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government is ""considering using any measures necessary"" to ensure the country has the medical equipment it needs to manage COVID-19. He said Canada might use its military procurement policy to get devices such as ventilators. Trudeau said Ottawa is looking to ""expedite access to lab test kits"" needed to diagnosis the illness. The prime minister said 50,000 Canadians have been tested for the novel coronavirus since the outbreak began, with 25,000 of those tests administered in the last week alone. ""The need for these test kits is growing,"" Trudeau said. The prime minister said the government is also ""fine-tuning"" the deal with the United States to close the shared border to non-essential visitors. He said he expects the border will be formally shut to travellers like tourists and shoppers between Friday and Saturday. People like international students, workers with visas and temporary foreign workers will still be allowed across. Truck freight will be permitted. Health Minister Adrian Dix urged all British Columbians to do their part to help contain the virus by avoiding crowds, working from home when possible and practising social distancing.  ""To those who have been reluctant … I want to say that your friends and your neighbours and your family are counting on you,"" he said. Trudeau said health officials' advice to the government is that social distancing requirements could last ""weeks or months."" Meanwhile Henry encouraged British Columbians to ""get outside"" but to stay apart. ""There are thing you can do, even if we are doing social distancing. You can walk your pet. You can go for a bike ride. You can play with your kids,"" she said. ""These are the things that you want to do, as a small group, as a family together, and maintain your distance from others when you're outside as well."" The B.C. government has announced the postponement of byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton that were scheduled to take place in April, as well as a referendum that was planned for Kamloops. The federal government pledged up to $82 billion on Wednesday to support the Canadian economy, businesses and workers. The plan includes a new Emergency Care Benefit to provide income support to workers who have to stay home but don't have access to paid sick leave. As the reality of the new restrictions on daily life sink in, British Columbians working and travelling in countries around the world are trying to heed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's advice to come home to Canada. But they're finding flight cancellations and closed borders make that very difficult, and they're having trouble getting help from Canadian embassy and consulate officials. Once back home in B.C., everyone returning from any international travel has been ordered to self-isolate for 14 days.  B.C.'s ban on gatherings of more than 50 people remains in effect. All bars and nightclubs have been ordered to close, and other businesses have been told to implement social-distancing measures to keep people one or two metres apart. Recent days have seen a steady stream of public facilities, businesses and stores shutting down to meet the recommendations of the provincial health officer.

That follows a similar announcement made earlier in the day by the mayor of Vancouver. ""The changes being announced today are major. They mean ... many, many people will be laid off,"" said Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart. ""We are doing this because we think this is what we need to do to keep vulnerable people from becoming seriously ill, or worse."" The city is taking its actions under the state of emergency declared by council on Thursday.  Stewart also warned all retail operations to ensure social distancing is enforced in their facilities, otherwise they will also face consequences. On Friday, West Vancouver and Pitt Meadows followed in Vancouver's footsteps and declared their own states of local emergency. West Vancouver Mayor Mary-Ann Booth explained, ""We need these powers to ensure everyone practices social responsibility, even if we need to compel."" A case of COVID-19 has been confirmed at another Metro Vancouver care home. There are now four long-term care facilities in the region with cases of the illness diagnosed in residents or staff. Fraser Health confirmed Friday a staff member at Dufferin Care Centre in Coquitlam, B.C., had been positively diagnosed. A statement said the staff member is in self-isolation at home. The health authority said it is ensuring other staff working at the centre do not work at any other facility as the investigation into the transmission continues. Residents and staff will be screened twice a day, the authority said. Visitors have also been restricted to essential visitors only. The Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver, Hollyburn House in West Vancouver and Haro Park Centre in Vancouver are all long-term care homes with confirmed cases among residents and/or staff. Eight of the nine COVID-related deaths in B.C. stem from the outbreak at the Lynn Valley centre. As B.C.'s health-care professionals and other essential workers continue to put in long hours in the midst of the pandemic, Henry has stressed that child-care services must be available for those who need them. On Friday, the B.C. government announced that providers who remain open during the crisis will receive compensation for doing so — amounting to seven times their average monthly government funding. The province says that should cover about three quarters of an average facility's monthly expenses. Henry has said that anyone who can care for their children should keep them at home during this pandemic. Child-care providers who close their doors will receive two times their average monthly government funding, which is meant to cover fixed costs like mortgages and leases. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada and the U.S. have finalized their mutual agreement to shut the border to non-essential travellers, such as tourists. Trudeau said Friday the closure will take effect at midnight. He also announced Canada and the U.S. have also reached a ""reciprocal arrangement [under which] we will now be returning irregular migrants who attempt to cross anywhere at the Canada-U.S. border. ""It's an exceptional measure,"" said Trudeau. As recently as Thursday, the government said the solution to screening refugee claimants was not to turn them away, but to assess their health when they were intercepted and then hold them in isolation for the standard 14 days. The Canadian government is launching support for manufacturers as they shift their focus to producing equipment needed to treat people for COVID-19, such as ventilators, masks and tests for the novel coronavirus. Trudeau said companies already making medical equipment will be able to increase production, while other businesses can shift their facilities to begin producing medical supplies. An example, Trudeau said, is the auto-parts sector moving to build medical gear instead. ""Canadian companies are among the most innovative and agile in the world, and we're very confident that we're going to be able to work with them to respond to the pressing needs in our health-care system."" In B.C., Henry announced on Friday afternoon that the province had identified another 77 cases of COVID-19. That brings the provincial total to 348, including eight people who have died. Of those people, 22 are in hospital, including 10 who are in intensive care. Six people have fully recovered. Two schools in Victoria each confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in their communities. The University of Victoria said one of its ""upper-level"" students who lives off campus is now recovering with the illness at home. The university said the student's family notified the school of the case. Students, parents, and staff with connections to St. Michaels University School in Victoria were notified late Thursday that a senior student has been diagnosed with the virus. A statement said the student contracted the illness from a family member at home and ""was unlikely to be infectious during his last days at school."" B.C. is now under a province-wide state of emergency. The declaration was made Wednesday to give the government broad and sweeping power to compel action while preserving supply chains of groceries and other essential items in the face of COVID-19. As of Friday, TransLink is implementing rear-door boarding on all its buses and making them free. Solicitor General Mike Farnworth said an ""all hands on deck approach"" through the state of emergency will allow for the delivery of federal, provincial and local resources in a co-ordinated way and complement the declaration of a public health emergency in B.C. announced Tuesday. The City of Vancouver unanimously approved its own local state of emergency on Thursday. A number of other municipalities, including Delta and New Westminster, have moved to do the same. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he expects new restrictions on non-essential travel at the Canada-U.S. border to take effect Friday night. Canadian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to get home, although the government says travellers presenting symptoms won't be able to board flights. Henry once again emphasized the time is now ""critical"" to build a firewall against the disease, as the numbers of cases remain in an upswing and health workers continue to work through a backlog of ""thousands"" of tests a day. ""There's been dramatic changes in our society and in the things we're doing here in British Columbia to slow down this virus,"" she said Thursday. ""The things that we're doing right now are going to save us in the next two weeks."" Henry stressed that her orders around social distancing, self-isolation and self-quarantine are ""not optional."" The emergency declarations give Henry and the province the power to enforce her demands, and she said they have been working with law enforcement agencies to discuss implementation.  Everyone returning from any international travel has been ordered to self-isolate for 14 days.  B.C.'s ban on gatherings of more than 50 people remains in effect. All bars and nightclubs have been ordered to close, and other businesses have been told to implement social-distancing measures to keep people one or two metres apart. Restaurants and cafés that cannot maintain distances of one to two metres between people have been told to move to takeout and delivery models. ""I would appeal to the business owners out there: do the right thing,"" said Henry. Recent days have seen a steady stream of public facilities, businesses and stores shutting down to meet the recommendations of the provincial health officer. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver has also advised its members to stop hosting open houses. Important reminders: B.C.'s top doctor, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said the risk of contracting coronavirus in B.C. communities remains low. Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 3:30 a.m. PT on Friday,  there were 873 presumptive and confirmed cases in Canada, with 12 deaths and 11 listed as recovered. British Columbia: 271 confirmed cases, including five recovered and eight deaths. Ontario: 258 confirmed cases, including five recovered and two deaths. Alberta: 146 confirmed cases, including one death. Quebec: 121 confirmed cases, including one recovered and one death. Saskatchewan: 20 confirmed and presumptive cases. Manitoba: 17 confirmed and presumptive cases. New Brunswick: 11 confirmed and presumptive cases. Nova Scotia: 14 confirmed and presumptive cases. Prince Edward Island: Two cases the province lists as positive. Newfoundland and Labrador: Three confirmed and presumptive cases. Repatriated Canadians: 10 confirmed cases. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Common symptoms include: But more serious symptoms can develop, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia. What should I do if I feel sick? Stay home.

2020-03-22T02:24:36.600Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-update-bc-what-you-need-to-know-march-21-1.5505496,"The last week has brought a complete upheaval to daily life in B.C., as everything from nightclubs to playgrounds and libraries has shut down in an attempt to halt the spread of COVID-19. On Saturday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry ordered personal service establishments like salons, spas, massage and tattoo parlours to close.  On Friday, Henry ordered restaurants and bars in B.C. to stop all dine-in services and move to takeout and delivery only. She ordered bars to shut down earlier in the week, and said any business that can't keep a distance of one or two metres between people should do the same. Both Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix reminded British Columbians that self-isolation measures are orders, and are not optional.   ""That is your obligation to your loved ones, to your community. It's also an order,"" Dix said on Saturday. ""It's everyone's obligation to comply."" Henry said the province can enforce the measures if required, including by issuing fines. Gatherings of more than 50 people are banned, and working from home has become the new norm. British Columbians have been reminded again and again about the importance of social distancing, and that things like play dates, dinner parties and basketball games are now verboten. For many British Columbians, life these days is largely lived at home, in small family units, with only virtual connections to friends and coworkers. Business closures, travel restrictions and the economic slowdown in general have also brought massive jobs losses — 500,000 people in Canada have applied for employment insurance in the last week. The province confirmed another 76 cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, bringing B.C.'s total to 424. Ten people have now died of the disease, including nine connected to the outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver, where 37 residents and 19 workers have tested positive for the coronavirus. There are now five long-term care facilities in the region with cases of the illness diagnosed in residents or staff. A staff member at the Delta View Care Centre in Surrey has been diagnosed with COVID-19. This is the second long-term care facility in the Fraser Health region that has had a staff member test positive for the disease.  The facility says there have been no other cases and additional measures are in place to check staff and residents for symptoms. Long-term care staff currently working there are being asked to not work at any other facility.  Of B.C.'s confirmed cases, 27 people are now in hospital, with 12 in intensive care, and seven people have fully recovered. Meanwhile, the provincial government says that by ordering the cancellation of non-urgent elective surgeries, it has made 2,398 acute care hospital beds available if they are needed for serious COVID-19 cases. The province is now in a state of emergency, as well as a public health emergency. Many municipalities have also declared local states of emergency that give them the power to crack down on those who aren't following the orders of public health officials. Island Heath announced it will only allow essential visits for patients who are critically ill, receiving end-of-life care, and for those who are frail and need an escort for their safety. Visitors who meet the criteria must not have a cough, runny nose, fever, sore throat or shortness of breath, and can't have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days, said the health authority. This week, Canada and the U.S. finalized their mutual agreement to shut the border to non-essential travellers, and the closure took effect on Friday at midnight. That follows Canada's move to bar entry to virtually all travellers who aren't Canadian citizens or permanent residents.  Canadians abroad have been told to come home while they still can, and everyone returning from any international travel has been ordered to self-isolate for 14 days.  Meanwhile, Canadian residents have been advised not to leave the country. As a result, airlines are reporting sharp declines in scheduled flights, leading to major layoffs. On Saturday morning B.C. Housing Minister Selina Robinson said ""help is on the way"" for renters during the COVID-19 crisis, and more details will be provided early in the week.  A moratorium on evictions due to non-payment of rent in housing that is managed by B.C. Housing has been introduced. She said work is also being done with social and supportive housing providers to make sure the same moratorium is in place for any homes receiving funding from B.C. Housing. Robinson said they are looking at the possibility of broader measures to prevent evictions, but did not provide specifics.  Shane Simpson, minister of social development and poverty reduction, said preparations are being made to help the most vulnerable people in the province, including those living on the street or in shelters. On Friday B.C. Parks closed off access roads to Mount Seymour and Cypress provincial parks, and restricted access to some lower-level trails in those areas.  Day hiking is still available in most other provincial parks, Environment Minister George Heyman said. However, playgrounds and campgrounds are closed until at least April 30. Washrooms and day-use facilities are also closed.  Metro Vancouver said its parks remain open as do parks in Vancouver. Officials ask people to enjoy the outdoors responsibly by keeping a two-metre distance and avoid crowds.   In North Vancouver, officials are shutting down Quarry Rock and Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge indefinitely as of 7 a.m. Sunday because people weren't following directives to stay far enough away from each other. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild.

On Sunday the Vancouver Park Board closed all public outdoor recreation facilities within parks and beaches, including volleyball, skate parks, field sports, and tennis courts. Port Coquitlam closed all sports courts, sports fields, and skate parks effective immediately. All public parks and trails in Port Coquitlam remain open.  The City of New Westminster also closed all city playgrounds, basketball and volleyball courts, and skate and all-wheel parks.  Health Minister Adrian Dix said efforts to stop the novel coronavirus are ""the greatest fight of our time.""

Restaurant and Food Services Association said restaurants with a liquor licence would be able to sell sealed liquor with take-out meals.  The next update from B.C. health officials is scheduled for Monday. For many, the pandemic's arrival during spring's first flush has provided a strong contrast.  The province confirmed another 76 cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing B.C.'s total to 424.

2020-03-24T03:58:11.651Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-update-bc-what-you-need-to-know-march-23-1.5506365,"Premier John Horgan and Finance Minister Carole James announced a $5-billion relief plan for B.C. citizens and businesses grappling with the coronavirus pandemic. James said the plan focuses on protecting the health and safety of British Columbians and frontline health-care workers; support for people and businesses; and setting the stage for B.C.'s ongoing financial recovery. ""This plan is a first step, but a critical step,"" James said, adding it could change going forward. It includes a one-time $1,000 tax-free payment to people whose ability to work has been hampered by the crisis. James said the plan also includes supports for seniors, renters and people with disabilities. ""No one will lose their apartment because of COVID-19,"" Horgan said. Tax deferrals and supports for businesses, including tourism businesses are also in the plan. The deferrals would be looked at again in the fall. During an emergency sitting of the legislature on Monday afternoon, MLAs also approved amendments to the Employment Standards Act that prevent employers from firing workers who have to take unpaid leave because they are sick, need to self-isolate or have to care for a child who is ill. The changes are retroactive to Jan. 27, the date the first presumptive case of COVID-19 was identified in B.C. Politicians and health officials both provincially and nationally have been stern in recent days about the seriousness of social, or physical, distancing: Stay home and stay away from others, or enforcement might become necessary. Still, a warm, sunny weekend saw hordes of people across the South Coast leave home to enjoy the spring weather on the region's beaches, trails and parks, with many crowding together for picnics, hikes, parties games — despite public health orders to avoid groups to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Outrage over people who refused to stay home and at least two metres apart from others prompted several municipalities to shut down their outdoor facilities. I keep posting video of the soccer games happening outside my house to show this isn’t a one-time group of people ignoring social distancing orders, but a constant stream of folks who should know better <a href=""https://t.co/1Hyh7H1BP1"">pic.twitter.com/1Hyh7H1BP1</a> On Monday, the City of Vancouver unanimously passed a motion allowing the city to fine businesses up to $50,000 and individuals up to $1,000 for not following new distancing rules. Canadians have been ordered to continue social distancing, or physical distancing, by staying home unless it's absolutely essential, keeping two metres away from the next person and avoiding groups — all to slow the spread of the virus and ease the burden on health-care workers. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Canadians to stay home, otherwise the federal government will use all measures available, including enforcement, to get people to listen. ""We've all seen the pictures online of the people who think they're invincible. You're not. Enough is enough. Go home and stay home,"" Trudeau said. The prime minister said he has another call with premiers across the country Monday night to discuss distancing orders. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said people can go outside for fresh air, but only with members of the same household and while staying away from others. Trudeau said the federal government is planning to invest $192 million to help create and produce vaccines for COVID-19 in Canada. He also announced $5 billion in additional lending capacity for farmers struggling through the outbreak, through Farm Credit Canada. In Vancouver, officials closed parking lots at its most popular beaches and shuttered outdoor recreation facilities like basketball and tennis courts.  Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said councillors will meet virtually Monday to pass a bylaw to allow fines of up to $50,000 for businesses that don't comply with the province's health orders.  Other cities including Port Coquitlam, Port Moody and New Westminster implemented similar closures of their outdoor facilities. North Vancouver closed popular trails like Quarry Rock and the Lynn Valley suspension bridge after crowds swarmed the trails. Meanwhile, some smaller B.C. communities like Squamish and Bowen Island are asking visitors to stay away altogether. Many of the Gulf Islands, popular destinations for weekends away, are also asking tourists not to come. The City of Victoria is working with B.C. Housing and Island Health in order to rapidly shelter its homeless population and increase social distancing.  ""No one thinks it's a good idea for people to be living outside at any time, but particularly in a health emergency,"" said Mayor Lisa Helps. For the time-being, the all-weather field in Beacon Hill and Topaz Park will be set up so people will have access to washrooms, washing facilities, meals, and the ability to shelter in a tent. Royal Athletic Park will be set up for the most vulnerable residents with additional support for mental health or addictions.  BC Housing has been directed to use any of the city's facilities to find indoor sheltering opportunities. Any buildings the city owns — like community centres or gyms — and possibly school district buildings could be used to temporarily house homeless residents for the next four to six months, Helps says. Over the weekend, Health Minister Adrian Dix said the effort to stop the novel coronavirus is ""the greatest fight of our time."" He reminded British Columbians that self-isolation measures are orders, and are not optional.   On Saturday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry ordered personal service establishments like salons, spas, massage and tattoo parlours to close.  On Monday the province confirmed another 48 cases of COVID-19, bringing B.C.'s total to 472. Health officials said 13 people have now died of the disease, 10 of them connected to the outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver, where 37 residents and 19 workers have tested positive for the coronavirus. Of B.C.'s confirmed cases, 33 people are in hospital, with 14 in intensive care, and 100 people are considered to be recovered. They have been cleared to stop isolating. There are now five long-term care facilities in the region with cases of the illness diagnosed in residents or staff. Meanwhile, some health-care workers say they're grappling with conflicting messages about whether they should be working if they've recently returned to Canada after travelling. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. Canada had 2,049 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19 and 24 deaths as of 2 p.m. PT on Monday. Here's a breakdown at the number of cases, including deaths and recoveries, by province and territory. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Common symptoms include: But more serious symptoms can develop, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia. What should I do if I feel sick? Stay home.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, at a briefing Tuesday afternoon with Health Minister Adrian Dix, said there have been no new deaths in that time and an additional 73 people have recovered, increasing the total of resolved cases to 173. Henry added that two new residential care homes have detected coronavirus cases: Little Mountain Place Residential Care in Vancouver and Evergreen Heights in White Rock have detected a single case each; a staff person at Little Mountain and a resident at Evergreen. Protocols are in place at those facilities to contain the spread, she said. ""We are seeing escalating numbers in British Columbia,"" Henry said. ""No community in this province is immune. ""None of us needs to get this virus and that's where ... physical distancing is so important."" Henry also spoke about the Pacific Dental Conference in Vancouver in early March. A B.C. dentist who attended the conference died of suspected COVID-19 complications, according to friends and family. Henry would not confirm the cause of the dentist's death and said the coroner is investigating. She said people in close contact with the dentist have been identified and put into isolation and at-risk people have been contacted. Henry said the conference was a ""major"" source of infections in B.C., with 32 cases linked directly or indirectly to it. Officials are again warning the public to obey health orders and continue staying home as much as possible, or risk enforcement to contain people indoors. ""If people do not follow these guidelines, we will put much more stringent measures in place,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday. ""Every day, someone asks me how long these restrictions will be in place. The truth is, we don't know yet,"" he added. ""The duration of this crisis will be determined by the choices we make right now."" Canadians have been told repeatedly to stay home as much as possible, avoid groups and keep two metres away from the next person while outdoors and visiting businesses like grocery stores and pharmacies. B.C. officials have said people can go outside for fresh air and exercise, but only close to members of the same household and at a distance from everyone else. ""If you want things to get back to normal, do your part. Stay home,"" Trudeau said. ""Do it for the health-care workers who we can't afford to lose during the biggest public health crisis our country has ever seen. Because here's the hard truth: If our nurses and doctors have COVID-19, they can't help you. They won't be able to treat you or your loved ones if you get sick. This is serious."" There are now 617 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in B.C., including 13 people who have died, but there are some signs of hope amid the crisis. On Tuesday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced 173 people have recovered from their illness and have been cleared to leave isolation. On Tuesday, B.C. Parks suspended services and closed facilities at all but four provincial parks to discourage people from getting outside in groups, for the safety of visitors and volunteers. The temporary measures affect marine parks, visitor centres, nature houses, playgrounds, washrooms and day-use facilities. Visitors can still use trails and areas that are accessible, but they will be responsible for their own safety. Mount Seymour, Cypress, Miracle Beach and Wells Gray provincial parks remain open, with some restrictions. Avalanche Canada is also stopping its avalanche forecasting for the season one month early for safety reasons and because the pandemic has made it impossible to gather data needed to put the forecasts together.  Health officials have faced repeated questions as to why they are not naming specific communities where people have tested positive for COVID-19, rather than identifying case numbers by region. On Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix said it's a privacy concern — but, also, officials don't want anybody to get complacent. ""Everyone needs to behave as if COVID-19 is in their community now."" Dix said a projection showing where health officials believe COVID-19 is going in the province is ""coming this week."" On Monday, residents of B.C. learned about the province's $5-billion relief plan, which includes $1,000 one-time payments for those who've been put out of work.  During an emergency sitting of the legislature on Monday afternoon, MLAs approved amendments to the Employment Standards Act that prevent employers from firing workers who have to take unpaid leave because they are sick, need to self-isolate or have to care for a child who is ill. Tenants who are struggling to pay the bills, however, are still waiting to hear whether there will be some form of rent relief. The City of Vancouver now has the power to fine businesses up to $50,000 and individuals up to $1,000 for not following the rules on social distancing. Many B.C. cities have now closed down outdoor sports facilities and playgrounds to keep make sure people are maintaining the required distance. Meanwhile, Premier John Horgan is resisting calls from some corners to order a complete ""lockdown"" on non-essential businesses. He told reporters it was not an approach he preferred. Councillors in White Rock, B.C., shut down the White Rock Pier on Monday night, after swarms of people visited the city's waterfront over the weekend. At the international level, the Tokyo Olympics have been officially postponed until 2021.

2020-03-25T23:09:51.996Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-update-bc-what-you-need-to-know-march-25-1.5509090,"The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in British Columbia has risen to 659, according to Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. In her daily briefing, Henry also confirmed another death at North Vancouver's Lynn Valley Care Centre, bringing the total number of deaths from the novel coronavirus at the long term care facility to 11. Fourteen people have died of COVID-19 in B.C. to date. The new numbers came as the federal government announced details around federal financial help for people who have lost income due to COVID-19. The new Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) will provide $2,000 a month for four months for people who have lost their income because of COVID-19. The CERB combines two previously announced benefits to simplify the application process. Canadians eligible for the benefit include, but are not limited to: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said an online application portal is expected to launch by April 6. He said applicants should receive their money within 10 days of signing up, which would be mid-April. In B.C., officials are preparing for the number of COVID-19 patients to rise significantly in the next few weeks by freeing up hospital beds to be ready in case a rush of new patients arrives. Henry said the virus had also spread to another long term care home where a health care worker has been detected with COVID-19. The Broadway Pentecostal Lodge is in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Six of the other long term care facilities identified with the virus have reported no new cases, but Henry said the infections at Haro Park in Vancouver's West End now include 28 residents and 27 staff. ""It does draw attention again to the fragility of our long term care facilities and the risks that we put the residents of long term care,"" Henry said. Henry said the province is developing an order to ensure that health care workers are able to limit their employment to one facility only and to add measures around personal protection and restriction of visitors in the outbreak facilities. A total of 64 British Columbians are in hospital with the virus, 26 of them in intensive care. Health Minister Adrian Dix has signalled officials are expecting many more hospitalizations in coming weeks. ""We are preparing for a much more difficult situation and … a much more difficult situation is pretty much inevitable,"" he told reporters Tuesday. More than 3,860 hospital beds are now available for COVID-19 patients in B.C., after the province ordered non-urgent elective surgeries to be cancelled. Dix has said the hospital system is running at around 68 per cent of its capacity, compared to the usual 103 per cent. Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry both said they are optimistic B.C. isn't following the same path as countries like Italy, which have seen healthcare systems overwhelmed by steep spikes in hospitalizations and deaths. Henry said she expects to unveil detailed modelling later this week to help put B.C.'s potential trajectory into perspective. In contrast to other regions closing down a wide range of amentities, Metro Vancouver is making ""every effort"" to keep most of its parks open. The region acknowledged how much green space can help the public's physical and mental health during the outbreak. ""However, if the situation changes, if the park rangers report that people are flouting the directions of the health officers, we will have no choice but to shut down our parks,"" said Jerry Dobrovolny, Metro Vancouver's chief administrative officer.  Canadians have been told repeatedly to stay home as much as possible, avoid groups and keep two metres away from the next person while outdoors and visiting businesses like grocery stores and pharmacies. Given that the incubation period for the coronavirus can be up to two weeks, cases will likely continue to rise in coming days even though British Columbians have been living under new restrictions to slow the spread. The rise in cases does not mean social distancing is not working; a number of cases confirmed now would have been transmitted before social distancing began. B.C. officials have said people can go outside for fresh air and exercise, but only in the company of members of the same household and at a distance from everyone else. Nearly half of all COVID-19 cases in Canada are now linked to transmission within the community, rather than travel, which means it's much more difficult to monitor how it's spreading. ""You don't know where the virus is at any particular moment in time, and now what you have is basically the potential for that person to pass it on to a much larger group of people,"" said Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of viral pathogenesis at the University of Manitoba. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. On Wednesday, Trudeau announced that Canada has accelerated its testing to 10,000 people per day and is ramping up production of emergency medical equipment and medication. More efforts — such as enforcing a mandatory 14-day quarantine for international travellers, which begins Wednesday at midnight — are also on their way as cases of COVID-19 increase. As of 6:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, there were more than 3,400 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19 in Canada, with 36 deaths and 197 cases listed by provinces as recovered or resolved. (Not all provinces are listing details about people who have recovered.)  There has also been one COVID-19-related death of a Canadian reported abroad. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's top public health officer, said a passenger of the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in Japan.

The provincial government has announced BC Hydro is offering a three-month bill credit to people who are out of work or working at a reduced wage because of the outbreak. The credit will be three times their average monthly bill over the previous year and will not have to be repaid. For small businesses forced to close during the pandemic, the utility is offering bill forgiveness for April, May and June. Premier John Horgan said large, industrial customers can have 50 per cent of their payments deferred for the next three months. In addition, the premier said the B.C. Utilities Commission has approved a one per cent rate drop ""across the board"" to help cut costs for customers. Both provincial and federal governments have said they are working to get billions in financial aid flowing to the public as soon as possible, in the form of tax breaks, bill deferrals, wage subsidies and breaks on loan payments. A rebate from the provincial government did not arrive in time for renters and landlords, though a ban on evictions did. Some tenants and landlords have worked out an understanding around rent between themselves. Commercial businesses are still calling for rent relief and an eviction moratorium as expenses continue to pile up. To help cover costs for frontline workers during the crisis, the helicopter airline Helijet has announced it will provide free seats for health-care responders travelling on business between Vancouver and the company's Vancouver Island terminals in Victoria and Nanaimo. The seats will be given to ""doctors, nurses or others in the health-care sector who may need to travel quickly to provide direct patient care,"" according to a statement. The District of North Vancouver has announced it's closing parking lots near many of its most popular parks, trails and waterfront spots. Starting April 4, parking lots near Deep Cove, Panorama, Cates Park/Whey-ah-Wichen and Kilmer Park will be closed, and new parking restrictions will take effect on streets near park and trail areas. ""These additional closures are to help flatten the curve and to prevent overcrowding in the District's parks and trails,"" said the DNV in a statement.  Many of North Vancouver's favourite nature spots are closed until further notice, among them Quarry Rock and Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, as well as skate parks, BMX tracks and picnic shelters. You can find a full list of North Vancouver closures here.  On Wednesday, B.C.'s Ministry of Education announced it has paid to license Zoom for teachers so they can host video calls that act as virtual classrooms for students while in-class learning is suspended due to the pandemic. Zoom is a video conferencing tool, primarily used for businesses, that has surged in popularity as a new way to connect since the outbreak forced millions of workers and families to stay home. The ministry said use of the software works under B.C.'s privacy legislation and will be available to teachers this month. B.C.'s provincial state of emergency has been extended until April 14 after 1,066 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 25 deaths. On Tuesday night, Premier John Horgan used a province-wide address to urge British Columbians to do their part by staying home whenever possible and keeping a two-metre distance from other people outside the home. ""What we do today will affect what our doctors, nurses and first responders face in the days and weeks ahead. It will determine how many of us stay healthy, and how much we can do to flatten the curve,"" he said.  ""You might not feel it in your living room, but everyone in B.C. is pulling together and there are early signs that our actions are making a difference. But we can't stop now."" Horgan's address followed the news that there has been an outbreak of COVID-19 among a group of temporary foreign workers at Bylands Nurseries in West Kelowna. Fourteen workers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and 63 other migrant workers are now in isolation, with more test results pending. COVID-19 cases have also been confirmed at two new long-term care facilities, for a total of 21 homes experiencing outbreaks in the Lower Mainland. Fraser Health said that one resident at the Swedish Assisted Living Residence in Burnaby and two residents at Chartwell Cedarbrooke Retirement Residence in Mission have been diagnosed with the disease. Meanwhile, Coast Mountain Bus Company says a bus driver in Port Coquitlam and an employee at the Burnaby Transit Centre have also tested positive. By Wednesday afternoon, 142 people were in hospital as a result of the virus, with 67 patients in intensive care. Just over half of all confirmed cases — 606 in total — have fully recovered. According to Henry, the peak of the outbreak is still to come in B.C., and it's crucial that people continue to keep their distance from others to minimize its impact. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of noon PT Wednesday, officials in Canada had reported at least 9,550 confirmed and presumptive cases, with 111 deaths. The provinces and territories that are providing details on recovered cases have listed a total of 1,594 as recovered. The numbers, which are updated at least daily by the provinces and territories, are not a complete picture, as they don't account for people who haven't been tested, those being investigated as a potential case and people still waiting to learn the results of their test.

This is the first positive test detected in a B.C. correctional facility, Henry said during her daily briefing. In the last 24 hours, there have been 55 new cases, bringing the total confirmed cases across the province to 1,121. Thirty-one people have now died from COVID-19 in B.C., including six people since Wednesday. ""The number of cases in B.C. is growing,"" said Henry. ""The number of cases hospitalized is growing.""  ""But we are seeing the growth in a manageable way here in B.C."" Henry credits physical distancing measures with slowing the spread of the disease. There are currently 149 people hospitalized due to COVID-19, including 68 in intensive care.  More than half of all confirmed patients — 641 in total — have fully recovered. Health officials also warned against tourism and other non-essential travel in British Columbia to protect small communities. ""There are many of our smaller communities concerned about people coming to vacation homes and I am asking people now to forego those types of travel,"" said Henry. She said those communities are particularly at risk if they experience outbreaks because they have access to fewer resources. Health Minister Adrian Dix also reminded travellers returning to B.C. that they are required to self-isolate for 14 days as per federal and provincial orders. ""We need, as always, 100 per cent of people to follow the rules, especially those coming back to Canada in the days and weeks to come."" The provincial government has announced it is increasing the monthly amount that people on income and disability assistance receive by $300, to help them during the COVID-19 crisis. Anyone on those programs who is not eligible for the federal government's emergency support programs will have the supplement automatically added to their cheques for the three months, starting April 22. Shane Simpson, B.C.'s Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, said low-income seniors will also receive the benefit. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced Wednesday that COVID-19 cases have also been confirmed at two new long-term care facilities, for a total of 21 homes experiencing outbreaks in the Lower Mainland. She said B.C. still has some tough weeks ahead, but said ""we will get through this"" if people continue to stay physically distant from each other while maintaining social connections in other ways. Also on Wednesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix issued a sharp reminder to travellers returning from abroad: they are legally required to self-isolate for 14 days or they will face fines and face possible jail time. The minister said it would be a ""a real betrayal"" to fellow British Columbians to break the rules, after people at home have made an effort to do the right thing. Meanwhile, the provincial government announced that BC Hydro is offering a three-month bill credit to people who are out of work or working at a reduced wage because of the outbreak. The credit will be three times their average monthly bill over the previous year and will not have to be repaid. The benefit does not apply to tens of thousands of FortisBC customers living in Kelowna, the Okanagan Valley, the Boundary region and a number of communities in the West Kootenay. For small businesses forced to close during the pandemic, the utility is offering bill forgiveness for April, May and June. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild.

That's three fewer patients in hospital than a day earlier and four fewer in the ICU. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced Thursday that the province has confirmed another 53 cases of COVID-19, for a total so far of 1,174. To date, 673 people have recovered from their illness. A patient at an in-patient rehabilitation centre in Abbotsford, B.C., has tested positive for COVID-19, as the number of care facilities affected by the illness continues to rise. Fraser Health confirmed a patient at the Cottage-Worthington Pavilion rehabilitation unit tested positive for the novel coronavirus. A statement said the authority is working with staff to identify anyone who may have been exposed. Also on Friday, TransLink's HandyDART contractor, First Transit, says that a driver working out of Richmond has tested positive for COVID-19. The employee's workspace and vehicle have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Public Health officials have given no indication that there is an elevated risk to the public at this time. The City of Vancouver has secured contracts to provide regular cleaning and meal delivery to residents at 21 single-room occupancy hotels on the Downtown Eastside. Mayor Kennedy Stewart says according to the latest updates from health officials there are currently no confirmed outbreaks or clusters in the neighbourhood, but the city expects that could change. It has moved to add new spaces to house vulnerable people. There are two new shelters, set up at two community centres, that can take up to 160 people. Hundreds of hotel rooms have also been secured and Stewart says B.C. Housing expects there are enough of them to meet the needs identified by local health authorities. The federal government has announced it is donating $100 million to organizations that can buy and deliver food to people in need across Canada, including in northern and Indigenous communities. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Food Banks Canada, the Breakfast Club of Canada and the Salvation Army are among those that will receive the funding. Speaking outside his Ottawa home Friday, Trudeau also announced the Canadian Armed Forces are being sent to northern Quebec to help communities there prepare to respond to COVID-19 at the province's request. The prime minister added the federal government has reached an agreement with Amazon to use the company's network to distribute medical supplies to meet provincial needs from coast to coast. BC Ferries has laid off more than 1,400 employees and cancelled a major route between Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island as the corporation faces a steep drop in traffic. A statement Friday said BC Ferries is seeing an 80 per cent drop in passengers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To save money, the corporation said it is suspending service on the Horseshoe Bay-Departure Bay route linking West Vancouver and Nanaimo for 60 days. The Property Assessment Appeal Board has extended the appeal deadline to June 1 from April 30. The board helps owners who disagree with the assessed value of their homes, which could affect their tax rate. The board says the pandemic may affect peoples' access to their right to appeal to the board. The extension only applies to appeals required to be filed by April 30. Locally, the provincial government announced a $1.5 million boost to the Indigenous Emergency Assistance Fund, which helps Indigenous post-secondary students facing financial hardship that affects their ability to finish their studies. Students at all 25 public post-secondary institutions in B.C., as well as Native Education College (NEC), are eligible for funding. The money does not need to be repaid and can be spent on living, medical or community expenses. Students can contact the Indigenous Student Service Centre on campus for help with the application process. The province announced a $3.5 million increase in funding for all domestic students on Thursday. On Thursday, B.C. confirmed its first outbreak of COVID-19 at a jail after an inmate tested positive for the novel coronavirus at the Okanagan Correctional Centre near Oliver, B.C.

As of Thursday, there were 149 COVID-19 patients in hospital, including 68 in intensive care. ""The number of cases hospitalized is growing,"" Henry said. ""But we are seeing the growth in a manageable way here in B.C."" Well over half of all confirmed patients — 641 in total — have fully recovered. Henry also warned Thursday against tourism and other non-essential travel within B.C. to protect small communities, which are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks because they have fewer health resources.

The update reflects two 24-hour time periods, with 26 new cases recorded between Saturday and Sunday, and 37 new cases recorded between Sunday and Monday. One more person has died from the virus. As of Monday afternoon there were 140 people in hospital in B.C., with 72 people in intensive care. The application portal for the federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit is now open for eligible Canadians who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 240,000 people had already successfully applied for the benefit within the first few hours after the process opened Monday morning. The emergency financial aid offers $2,000 a month for up to four months to help businesses and families struggling to make ends meet because of the pandemic, including those not eligible for EI, contract employees and freelancers. The application window has been staggered by birth month. People born in January, February and March can apply Monday. People with birthdays later in the year will have their days later this week. Speaking just after 8 a.m. PT, the prime minister said changes will be announced in ""coming days"" to offer help for people who aren't currently eligible for the CERB, such as students and people whose hours have been reduced but not cut entirely. ""There are groups of people who aren't benefitting from the [CERB] who probably should,"" Trudeau said. Henry said that B.C.'s curve appears to be flattening, with the percentage of cases no longer increasing daily. She said this tentative bit of good news is thanks to luck, timing and early preparation on B.C.'s part. She said B.C. recorded some of the earliest cases of COVID-19 in the country and was able to implement measures earlier on. But Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix urged B.C. residents to remain steadfast in their commitment to social distancing, especially as temperatures rise and a number of religious holidays come up over the long weekend. Henry also announced an additional outbreak in a federal correctional facility in B.C. With the goal of physical distancing in mind, the City of Vancouver says staff have made 14,300 visits to local businesses to make sure they're complying with public health orders. Staff have issued 19 orders to comply with those orders, and suspended the licence of one business. Meanwhile, they've also completed 500 inspections of construction sites, and handed out nine warnings about keeping workers at a distance from each other. Starting Monday, there will be a further reduction of transit services in Metro Vancouver on bus and SeaBus due to plunging ridership and financial pressure.  The SeaBus will only run every 30 minutes, all day long, instead of the usual 15-minute intervals As of Wednesday, West Coast Express Train 4 will be cancelled. Buses with very low ridership will have reduced service. The federal government is bringing in further measures to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 on commercial passenger vessels and ferries. Ferries and essential passenger vessel operators are to immediately reduce the maximum number of passengers carried on board by half in an effort to comply with physical distancing rules. Transport Canada said operators will also implement alternative practices to reduce the spread of the virus, such as keeping people in their vehicles. It said the measures will be in place until at least June 30. BC Ferries chopped its service by half this weekend after it said ridership was down by 80 per cent. In response, Harbour Air said it is resuming daily flights between downtown Vancouver and Nanaimo to bridge the service gap. A statement said the flights are only to ""support essential travel for a community that now has limited options"" and anyone who does not need to travel should stay home.  Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. There are now more than 15,800 test-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, with cases recorded in every province and territory except Nunavut. As of 7:30 a.m. PT on Monday, CBC News has counted a total of 307 COVID-19 related deaths in Canada. The provinces and territories that offer information on people who have recovered listed more than 3,280 COVID-19 cases as resolved. The numbers, which are updated at least daily by the provinces and territories, are not a complete picture, as they don't account for people who haven't been tested, those being investigated as a potential case and people still waiting for test results.  For a look at what's happening across the country and the world, check the CBC interactive case tracker.

2020-04-08T23:19:24.206Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-8-1.5525651,"B.C. health officials announced Wednesday that a slight reduction in the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 is a positive sign, but that a total of 48 people have now died from the virus across the province. Across B.C. hospitals, 135 patients are being treated for COVID-19, including 61 in intensive care units. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced there have been five more deaths in the past 24 hours, including one at the Lynn Valley Care Centre and two at the Amica Edgemont Village. There were 45 new positive cases on Wednesday, bringing the provincial total to 1,336 confirmed cases. There is hope B.C. is starting to control its spread of COVID-19, but health officials continue to be concerned the upcoming holiday weekend could bring new chances to spread the disease. Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday that all travellers returning to B.C. from abroad in coming weeks will now be required to present a formal self-isolation plan to provincial and federal authorities before being allowed to pass customs. Travellers will be provided forms and will have to explain, in detail, how the person plans to self-isolate. These will be considered legal documents. The federal government is responsible for enforcement the 14 days of self-isolation under authority of the Quarantine Act.  ""This is not a suggestion,"" Horgan said. ""We have an expectation of those that have been away — as grateful as they are, I'm sure, to be back in British Columbia — to pick up the ball and carry it as we have."" Returning British Columbians must have a self-isolation plan starting Wednesday. However, the official forms will be provided on flights and at land borders starting Friday. Repatriation flights carrying Canadians back home have already landed as of last weekend and more are expected in the coming days. Service B.C. will stay in contact with those self-isolating at home through phone calls or text messages. Henry says the province will be providing support through grocery and medication deliveries where necessary. The premier said the changes will apply to land borders as well as Vancouver International Airport. For those who don't have a plan, a quarantine site will be set up while they prepare one. If they don't come up with a plan, they will spend 14 days of self-isolation at the site. People who are symptomatic will not be allowed to leave the airport.  ""We need to make sure that all the work that Canadians have been doing is not erased by people coming back that don't have the same awareness. Horgan did, however, grant one ""egg-ception"" to the travel restrictions: He said the Easter Bunny is allowed to travel freely through the province this weekend. B.C. Parks is closing every provincial park in the province, effective immediately, to reinforce the need for people to stay home this weekend after visitors failed to stay far enough apart in recent weeks. ""This action is difficult but necessary,"" said B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman wrote in a statement Wednesday.  ""This applies to British Columbians and out-of-province visitors who were planning to visit or stay at our provincial parks. The message is clear: Stay home, avoid travel, do not put yourself or others at risk."" BC Ferries has announced it is scaling back the number of trips to and from the Southern Gulf Islands. Starting April 10, and for the next 60 days, only one ship, the Salish Raven, will travel back and forth between Tsawwassen and Swartz Bay. It will stop en route at Pender, Mayne and Galiano. The Queen of Cumberland will travel between Swartz Bay, Saturna, Mayne, Galiano and Pender islands. BC Ferries is suspending service to Long Harbour on Salt Spring Island. The island will be served by its two other routes, Swartz Bay to Fulford Harbour and Crofton to Vesuvius. The revised sailings schedule will be available online in the coming days, according to BC Ferries. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix both expressed concerns Tuesday about the long weekend ahead. They pleaded with British Columbians to stay at home and resist the temptation to travel. ""It is important that we don't go to communities that don't have the resources to support us if we get sick,"" said Henry. In the East Kootenay, the regional district has gone so far as to ask the provincial government to close the border with Alberta to stop residents of that province from holidaying in B.C.  Henry, however, says she doesn't have the authority to shut down a provincial boundary. She and Dix added they're pleased with faith leaders' plans to celebrate all of the upcoming religious holidays virtually. The number of patients hospitalized with the novel coronavirus has levelled out in recent days, even falling slightly from 149 on Saturday to 138 by Tuesday. At the same time, the rate at which new cases have been confirmed has slowed, with 25 new cases announced Tuesday, for a total of 1,291. A total of 805 people — nearly two-thirds of all patients — have recovered from their illness. However, 43 patients have died. On Wednesday, Vancouver mayor Kennedy Stewart called on the provincial government to provide the municipality with a $200 million emergency grant to prevent financial disaster. He said city hall is facing a serious gap in funding that it won't be able to make up in the near future. The City of Vancouver is already trying to stem financial losses by issuing temporary layoff notices to 1,500 staff, by placing restrictions on hiring and travel, and with a capital spending review. Stewart says the municipality is losing between $4 and $5 million in revenue a week due to a 50 per cent reduction in non-tax revenue from community centres, libraries and other facilities shutting down as well as the suspension of parking fine enforcement. The city is also incurring costs to respond to COVID-19, particularly in the Downtown Eastside. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday the federal wage-subsidy program for employers affected by COVID-19 will have looser requirements than previously announced. Rather than having to show a 30 per cent decline in revenues, he said employers can show a 15 per cent decline in March. They can also compare their revenues to previous months rather than the previous year. The prime minister also announced changes to the Canada Summer Jobs program, which is being reconfigured to match students looking for summer work with industries still hiring during the pandemic. Trudeau said the federal government will pay 100 per cent of the wages paid by employers through the program. Trudeau said the government is working on further measures to financially support self-employed entrepreneurs, small businesses and young people who aren't eligible for existing emergency financial aid programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 3 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Canada had 17,897 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19. The provinces that release data on patients considered recovered had listed 4,054 cases as resolved. CBC News, which has been tallying the reported deaths, has recorded 421 COVID-19-related deaths in Canada, with two known coronavirus-related deaths of Canadians abroad. The numbers, which are updated at least daily by the provinces and territories, are not a complete picture, as they don't account for people who haven't been tested, those being investigated as a potential case and people still waiting for test results.  For a look at what's happening across the country and the world, check the CBC interactive case tracker.

In the lead up to the Easter long weekend, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry pleaded with residents to stay committed to staying close to home, practising physical distancing and not travelling. At her daily briefing on Saturday, Henry said ""what happens this weekend is going to be reflected in what we see in the coming weeks.""  On Friday, there were numerous examples of people heading to smaller communities as the sun shone bright and temperatures rose. Locals in smaller communities across the province voiced their frustrations Friday as visitors began arriving for the long weekend, potentially carrying COVID-19 to remote areas that don't have the resources to handle a major outbreak. The concern comes as B.C. seems to be having more success in managing the pandemic than other jurisdictions.  Hospitalizations and active cases of COVID-19 have been flat for the last 10 days. The number of new cases and deaths continues to increase, but at a slower rate than two weeks ago. It got to the point where Henry has alluded to the possibility of returning to some activities that have been curtailed since mid-March.  Many parks, beaches and other recreation areas in and around Metro Vancouver are closed, along with all provincial parks. The closures are an attempt to keep crowds from gathering while bylaw officers and ambassadors in municipalities are out watching for anyone not observing physical distancing measures. Henry is still encouraging people to get outside, but to do it while respecting physical distancing rules. To date, B.C. has confirmed 1,445 cases of the virus and reported 58 deaths. Thirty-five new cases were announced Saturday, along with three new deaths. The number of fully recovered patients is 905. There are now 20 active outbreaks in long-term care homes in the Lower Mainland, while the number of cases at Mission Institution, a federal prison, continues to climb, with 26 confirmed. The Union of Canadian Correctional Officers said four corrections officers from Mission Institution have tested positive for COVID-19. In Ottawa, Parliament was back in session on Saturday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered an address in the House of Commons on the government's work to support Canadians and limit the impacts of COVID-19. He said his government is working on legislation to support workers and businesses with a new wage subsidy.  On Saturday, the province announced one-time micro grants worth either $500 or $2,000 for musicians wanting to produce music and livestream it to British Columbians during the pandemic through a program called Showcase BC. British Columbians can access all the grant performances through the Showcase BC website. Vancouver singer and songwriter Dan Mangan said, as part of the government release, that most musicians are making efforts to lift peoples' spirits during the pandemic and the extra funding is welcome. ""Getting access to funding to keep the artistic community afloat makes all the difference to me and my peers,"" he said. The province said it was working on a concert to be shown online next week on the site featuring B.C. musicians. It expects to announce the lineup soon. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 3 p.m. PT Saturday, Canada had 23,318 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19. The provinces and territories that provide data on recovered cases listed 6,663 as resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths, which is based on public health information and reporting, lists 702 COVID-19-related deaths in Canada, as well as two coronavirus-linked deaths of Canadians abroad.

Three more people died due to COVID-19 over the weekend. All three were connected to long-term care homes, two in the Vancouver Coastal Health authority's jurisdiction and one in Fraser Health.  Outbreaks are ongoing in 21 long-term care and assisted-living homes. South Granville Park Lodge in Vancouver is the latest to be added to the list. Henry said 134 people in British Columbia were in hospital with COVID-19 as of Tuesday. Fifty-eight were in intensive care. Speaking to specific outbreaks, Henry said there were three more COVID-19 cases among a group of temporary workers at a nursery operation who are now in quarantine. At the Mission Institution, a federal medium-security prison in Mission, B.C., 41 inmates and correctional officers have tested positive for COVID-19, with seven in hospital, Henry said Tuesday. She said Abbotsford Regional Hospital has set up a dedicated unit to care for people infected in that outbreak and the province's Mobile Medical Unit has been deployed to Abbotsford to help with the prison outbreak.  Tuesday's briefing fell on the four-year anniversary of B.C.'s declaration of another public health emergency. On April 14, 2016, the province declared an emergency over the growing number of overdose deaths.  On the anniversary, Henry spoke to people living with addiction and their families and assured them they are still a priority. ""I want you to know you are not alone,"" she said. ""We're not letting [the COVID-19] crisis overtake the importance of our response to our overdose crisis and the work that we need to continue to do to support people who use drugs."" Henry said that work includes addressing homelessness and mental heath issues and supporting people living with addictions. Henry also said Monday B.C. would need to consider a number of factors before setting a date for current restrictions to be eased, including the status of cases in neighbouring provinces, the ability to monitor the border with the U.S. and quickly detect outbreaks and the capacity of B.C.'s health-care system. When asked Tuesday about concerns in some B.C. communities about long-weekend tourists travelling unnecessarily, Henry urged people not to make assumptions. ""We need to be thoughtful about people and not just assume that because you see a licence plate or you see someone you don't recognize that they don't have a valid reason for doing what they're doing,"" she said. Some might be students returning home, she said. Some might be checking up on loved ones Health Minister Adrian Dix said ""overwhelmingly"" British Columbians are getting the message to stay at home and there's no data to suggest widespread violations of stay-at-home orders or advice. On Tuesday, Premier John Horgan said the way in which B.C. returns to normal will also inform how the government rolls out additional financial help for business owners looking to recover. The premier also praised B.C.'s ""flattening of the curve,"" though he said it's still a cautious optimism and the province has to stay committed and stay home. ""I'm very proud to be in B.C. today ... I believe that we are on the right track,"" Horgan said. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 5 p.m. PT Tuesday, there were 27,063 reported cases in Canada. A tally of deaths linked to the novel virus maintained by CBC News has 978 deaths recorded in Canada.

2020-04-16T02:20:19.190Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-15-1.5532586,"Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced Wednesday three more people have died of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. In total, 75 people in B.C. have died of the disease. Henry said one of those deaths was the first in the Interior Health region. That person was a man in his 60s who was recovering at home. In the past 24 hours, B.C. has recorded 44 new cases, bringing the total number to 1,561. A total of 955 people have recovered. Henry said 131 people are in hospital, including 59 in intensive care.  No new outbreaks were reported at long-term care homes. As of Wednesday, 21 homes have outbreaks of COVID-19 accounting for 265 cases. At the Mission Institution, a federal prison, 48 cases have been found. Seven people are in hospital as a result of that outbreak. There is one case at the provincial Okanagan Correctional Centre. Three new cases have been detected related to an outbreak at a nursery in the Okanagan that has infected a total of 26 people.  Premier John Horgan said B.C.'s state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic has been extended another two weeks. That means the state of emergency will last through the end of day April 28, giving the government continued power to take any steps necessary to respond to the health-care crisis and preserve the province's supply chains. Cabinet approved the extension Wednesday. Horgan said he was ""hopeful"" that pandemic data modelling coming from provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry later in the week would be positive news. ""i believe that people have cause for genuine celebration collectively — and virtually, I should say — for the work we've done together to flatten the curve,"" Horgan said. ""But we still have more work to do."" Horgan said that information would be presented Friday. The premier added that any relaxation of emergency orders will come gradually, an approach he expected other jurisdictions to take, and will involve the direction of health authorities like Dr. Henry. The federal government is relaxing eligibility requirements for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to include people who are still earning but with lower incomes, seasonal workers and those who have run out of employment insurance. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday people who earn up to $1,000 per month will soon be able to access the benefit. Seasonal workers and people at the end of their EI will also qualify for the $2,000-a-month benefit. The prime minister said the government is planning to work with provinces to boost pay for essential workers making less than $2,500 per month, which would include many people who work in long-term care homes. Speaking outside his Ottawa residence Wednesday, Trudeau also said a New Brunswick corporation, LuminUltra, is increasing production of chemical reagents needed to provide the required weekly supply for COVID-19 tests in all provinces. He added Canada also received a new shipment of swabs required for the tests. Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart provided an update on that city's financial situation, saying that if a large number of homeowners don't pay their entire 2020 property tax bill — as one-quarter of survey respondents said might happen — the city would face tough decisions going forward. ""This is what keeps me up at night,"" Stewart told reporters. ""We simply don't have the reserves do deal with a half-a-billion-dollar shortfall."" The city has already laid off 1,500 workers out of its 11,000-strong workforce. The mayor hinted further efforts to trim the city's expenses could mean further layoffs. Stewart said without provincial help, the city has limited options. The cash reserves, he said, stand at about $130 million. There are billions of dollars in assets, he said, but most of it is in real estate and not easily converted into cash. The mayor added it would be ""short-sighted"" and ""dumb"" to sell those assets during a global financial crisis. The B.C. government on Wednesday said it had installed around 20 portable toilets at commercial pull-outs and inspection stations across the province for long-haul truck drivers who continue to transport essential goods during the pandemic. The British Columbia Trucking Association had previously said drivers' access to food and clean bathrooms had been cut down during the outbreak, as many of their traditional pit-stops had closed. The province said the toilets were installed over the weekend. A statement said officials will consider ""adding additional ones in the coming weeks."" At the national level, the Canada Border Services Agency announced Wednesday it is changing hours at 27 low-traffic U.S.-Canada crossings across the country as part of the government response to COVID-19. The affected crossings in B.C. are Cascade, Nelway and Rykerts. Preliminary data from Statistics Canada Wednesday showed economic activity collapsed in March as it dropped a record nine per cent. The Bank of Canada is warning that the downturn tied to COVID-19 will be the worst on record and that the economic recovery will depend on the effectiveness of current measures to bring the pandemic under control. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 7 p.m. PT Wednesday, Canada had reported 28,379 presumptive and confirmed cases of COVID-19. A tally of COVID-19 deaths maintained by CBC News has recorded 1,056 deaths in Canada, with another two coronavirus-related deaths abroad.

2020-04-17T02:15:30.974Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-16-1.5533967,"Seventy-eight people have now died of COVID-19 in B.C., and 1,575 have had confirmed cases of the disease. As of Thursday evening, there were 120 patients in hospital with the novel coronavirus, including 56 in intensive care. Officials said 983 people have now recovered, though Vancouver Coastal Health has not updated its number of recoveries since April 8. While B.C. has kept hospitalizations and confirmed cases to manageable levels so far, officials are warning the public that a return to normal life is still a long time away. ""It's important for us to be patient and to be kind to each other. It is going to be some weeks before we can let up even a little bit,"" provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Wednesday. The province said in a statement Thursday that there have been two new outbreaks within the last day — one in the Kootenay Street Village long-term care facility in Cranbrook, B.C., and in an acute care unit at Ridge Meadows Hospital in Maple Ridge.  Four facilities where the outbreak had been declared over have new cases.  Altogether, 26 long-term care homes and assisted living facilities have outbreaks, along with one acute care unit. Federal officials say 61 cases have been confirmed at Mission Institution, a federal prison in the Fraser Valley. Correctional Service Canada confirmed one inmate died of COVID-19 complications at Abbotsford Regional Hospital on Wednesday.  The federal government agency said this is the first such death at one of its correctional institutions. The identity of the inmate has not yet been released. The B.C. Coroners Service is investigating.  ""Our heartfelt condolences go out to the family of the deceased during this difficult time,"" said Bill Blair, the federal minister of public safety and emergency preparedness. On Thursday, Fraser Health also confirmed one case of COVID-19 in a staff member at the North Fraser Pretrial Centre. There is still one COVID-19 case at the provincial Okanagan Correctional Centre. A total of 26 people have been infected at Bylands Nurseries in West Kelowna.  Henry said Wednesday she has heard some concerns from people with non-COVID health concerns who are reluctant to go to hospital. She said despite the pandemic, British Columbians should not to ignore urgent medical matters or skip scheduled vaccinations — especially vaccinations for children. ""Please be reassured that these services are still available and it is still incredibly important to protect our children from the other infectious diseases that we know can spread in our communities,"" Henry said. A long-time Victoria homeless advocate says volunteers and supplies are desperately needed at Topaz Park where 100 people are living. Don Evans, the former CEO of the outreach society Our Place, asked anyone with social work, security or health-care experience to apply online to help keep the camp running in an orderly fashion: keeping campers from encroaching on the neighbourhood, making sure everyone gets the services they need and ensuring physical distancing is being followed as per public health orders. The Vancouver Aquarium is looking for help of a different kind: CEO Lasse Gustavsson says without financial aid it could shut down permanently within several months.  The Stanley Park attraction has lost more than $3 million since it closed due to the pandemic on March 17. It has already laid off 60 per cent of its staff but it costs $1 million per month to feed and care for the 70,000 animals housed there. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 6 p.m. PT on Thursday, Canada had 30,106 presumptive and confirmed coronavirus cases. A tally of COVID-19 deaths maintained by CBC News has recorded 1,250 deaths in Canada, with another two coronavirus-related deaths abroad. The numbers are not a complete picture, as they don't account for people who haven't been tested, those being investigated as a potential case and people still waiting for test results.  For a look at what's happening across the country and the world, check the CBC interactive case tracker.

The copy that follows reflects those changes, with a correction at the bottom. The COVID-19 curve is flattening in B.C. The worst-case scenarios did not come to pass and measures to limit disease transmission have been effective. Those were some of the takeaways from a briefing led by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix Friday morning where updated modelling of B.C.'s COVID-19 situation was shown to the public. Henry said some restrictions could be lifted next month if the progress continues but she also said British Columbians should not expect life to return to pre-COVID days anytime soon. ""Our new normal for the coming months, and it may be some time, is going to be modifications of what we're seeing right now,"" Henry said. ""We must hold that line."" A statement from the province later Friday said B.C. recorded 43 new cases of COVID-19 and no new deaths in the last 24 hours. As of Friday afternoon, the province has had 1,618 test-positive cases of the illness and 78 deaths. At least 966 people have recovered from COVID-19, a decrease from the 983 reported one day earlier. That change reflects new criteria used by Vancouver Coastal Health for someone to be considered recovered, the province said  A total of 119 patients are currently in hospital, including 52 in intensive care.  There are ongoing outbreaks at 20 long-term care homes, two provincial correctional centres and one federal prison. There have been no new outbreaks in the past day. The Mission Institution, the federal prison, has seen 63 people test positive for the novel coronavirus, six of whom are in hospital. One person has died in relation to that outbreak. There is also an outbreak in an acute care ward at Ridge Meadows Hospital. Among the slides Henry and Dix showed to the public were various scenarios of increases of person-to-person contact limitations extending into June and how those could impact hospitalizations. She said until a vaccine is developed, British Columbians will need to walk the line between managing transmissions and avoiding the ""unintended consequences"" of the restrictions on society. ""We're a long way from done,"" Dix said. Examples of activities that could return in a few weeks include elective surgeries, as well as changes that would help reactivate sectors of the economy. Some activities in schools could resume, but no decision has been made on whether that will happen before the end of the academic year.   British Columbia is beginning to develop new COVID-19 projections that could allow the province to ease some restrictions next month if active cases and hospitalizations continue to fall. British Columbians rate themselves quite highly in adhering to physical distancing measures but are far more critical of the province's efforts as a whole, a new survey suggests. In the last week, the B.C. government has continued to announce provincewide recoveries from COVID-19 — while quietly hiding the fact that data from Vancouver Coastal Health is no longer being included.  Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 3 a.m. PT on Thursday, Canada had 30,106 confirmed coronavirus cases.

On Saturday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. must find a ""sweet spot"" for increasing social interactions over the summer. Henry said B.C. residents will likely have more opportunities for social interactions over the next few months, but that ""realistically, there will be no major events this summer."" The province says that if the number of people with active novel coronavirus infections continues on its downward trend, some currently restricted activities could be allowed as early as a month from now. Until then, officials say British Columbians can't let up on strict physical distancing measures and diligent hand washing to halt the spread of COVID-19. As of Saturday, B.C. has confirmed a total of 1,647 cases of the virus and 81 people have died. Henry announced 29 new cases on Saturday and three additional deaths.

Vancouver police arrested 14 people after a group of community members of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside broke into Lord Strathcona Elementary School on Saturday evening to use it for what they called ""emergency housing."" Spokespeople for the group said the action was taken because it was impossible for thousands of homeless people to follow the provincial government's instructions to stay home amid the COVID-19 crisis.

She has also ordered B.C. workers returning from the Kearl Lake project in northern Alberta to self-isolate after seven of them tested positive for COVID-19. So far, 1,039 people have fully recovered from the coronavirus. Metro Vancouver's transit authority announced Monday morning it is laying off almost 1,500 employees and reducing bus, SkyTrain, SeaBus and West Coast Express services. TransLink said it was making several changes in its operating structure in a bid to lessen financial losses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The salaries of senior executives are also being reduced and maintenance, rehabilitation and expansion projects are being postponed. TransLink says it's also reaching into its cash reserves to sustain essential service. The authority says it is losing $75 million per month as ridership dropped by 83 per cent. The province is implementing a new healthcare framework for rural, remote and Indigenous communities to improve access to critical and culturally appropriate healthcare during COVID-19. Improvements will include better modes of land and air transportation including 55 new ambulances. A statement from the government says the new framework will remain flexible ""so local leaders in rural, remote and Indigenous communities can adapt it to meet their unique needs."" Housing options within communities will be provided for those who need to self-isolate. Virtual health care will also become more accessible. The annual 420 cannabis celebration, which normally draws thousands of people to Sunset Beach in Vancouver's West End on April 20, has been cancelled. It will instead be hosted virtually. Vancouver police said officers are still monitoring locations where smaller groups of people may gather, despite physical distancing measures in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. ""There is no group or area that has organized for any specific location, but we will be monitoring the traditional locations of Sunset Beach and the art gallery,"" said Sgt. Aaron Roed in a statement emailed to CBC News. ""VPD officers will also be monitoring any location that may pop up as a grouping location.""

Fifty-one patients are currently being treated in intensive care.  Another senior living in long-term care has died of COVID-19, bringing the total deaths linked to the disease in B.C. to 87.Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced Tuesday that B.C. has confirmed 25 more cases of COVID-19, for a total of 1,724 so far, while 1,041 people have recovered. At the Mission Institution, 76 people have tested positive, including 65 inmates and 11 staff. A new outbreak has been confirmed at a Vancouver food processing plant. Henry said 28 workers at Vancouver's United Poultry Company Ltd. who have tested positive from the disease. The plant has been shut down, and Henry addressed fears about the safety of its products. ""We don't have any evidence that COVID-19 can be spread from meat,"" she said. Though she did encourage following good hygiene practices during food handling and preparation.  Vancouver Coastal Health was notified of a positive case on Sunday, the health authority along with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are investigating.  On Tuesday, restaurant and bar owners started brainstorming ways to open again under strict guidelines, after Dr. Henry asked the industry Monday to come up with innovative ideas to partially reopen in the coming weeks, with physical distancing and no more than 50 patrons at a time in an establishment. As for other businesses like dental offices or physiotherapy, where close contact is unavoidable, Dr. Henry said the setups for those business will have to be revised to ensure physical distancing and good hand hygiene.  She pointed to examples such as not having everyone sitting in the waiting room at the same time, seeing less patients in a day and ensuring there is separation between staff. Also Tuesday, Vancouver-based exercise apparel brand Lululemon issued statements apologizing for the actions of one of its art directors who promoted a T-shirt design linking the coronavirus to Chinese takeout that triggered outrage and accusations of racism online.  B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix is encouraging people to seek out care if they need it after emergency room visits dropped off and some physicians raised concerns about it. ""The health-care system is there for you. There are many, many people who are struggling with non-COVID-19 conditions and that system is there for you,"" said Dix. He said the number of emergency room visits is returning to more normal levels. On April 6, daily emergency visits fell below 3,000 but as of April 21, there were over 4,000 visits. While still far below visits in March, before the pandemic was declared, it is starting to pick up. Dr. Henry said once a vaccine becomes available there are plans in place for mass vaccination clinics. Health-care workers, seniors and those who are immunocompromised will be prioritized.  ""It doesn't mean that everybody has to have this, and certainly, we don't have any mandatory immunizations in this country and I would not see us having mandatory immunization either,' said Henry.

2020-04-23T00:40:51.174Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-22-1.5540683,"B.C. has now seen 90 people die of COVID-19, and 1,795 have had confirmed infections with the novel coronavirus. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 103 COVID-19 patients in hospital, down from a peak of 149 on April 4. Forty-six patients are currently being treated in intensive care.  A total of 1,079 people have recovered from the disease. Three new long-term care homes in the Fraser Health region are experiencing active outbreaks, while four other long-term care homes in the same health authority have been cleared. The latest numbers released on Tuesday followed news of a new community outbreak at Vancouver's United Poultry Company chicken processing plant, where 28 workers have tested positive for COVID-19. ""This tells us we have more work to do to break the chains of transmission in our communities,"" said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C's provincial health officer. Henry says she understands people are tired of staying at home but without a decline in cases and outbreaks it won't be possible to ease restrictions. ""We can't afford to have any weaknesses in our firewall if we are going to be able to move ahead in to our new normal,"" she said.  Henry once again urged people to stay home if they're not feeling well ""with no exception right now."" She said that includes whether you're experiencing mild symptoms or even if you think it's just allergies. Dr. Henry also asked employers to not penalize employees if they're sick and to ensure those working can keep a safe distance from each other.  ""An outbreak in your business has effects on all of us,"" said Henry, also pointing out the significant financial impact it will have on the business as immediate shutdowns are required to deal with the outbreak.  Fraser Health says all inmates and staff, including non-correctional staff, at the Mission Institution will be tested for COVID-19. The number of positive cases at the Mission Institution went up to 77. Five of those inmates are in hospital, making the medium-security prison the site of the largest outbreak of the virus at a federal institution in Canada. Earlier this month, an inmate died of apparent COVID-19 complications after being taken to Abbotsford Regional Hospital. The identity of the inmate has not been released. Correctional Services Canada has said this is the first such death at one of its correctional institutions.   The Vancouver School Board says it is opening in-school instruction for students with ""exceptionally high learning needs"" that depend on face-to-face interaction with education support workers and specialized life skills programs. Attendance is optional, only for these select students, and initially will only be happening at one city school that has these specific programs. In a statement, VSB said the plan is to offer the program a few days a week with a student support worker and a teacher. A letter sent April 17 from Warren Williams, president of CUPE Local 15 Vancouver, to members said there would be no more than three students at a time in the school three times per week. Members were told they are not required to wear masks but the VSB will provide hand sanitizer and gloves. School districts continue to take direction from provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, who has yet to announce when it will be safe for all B.C. students to return to the classroom. Nationally, the federal government has announced the new $9-billion Canada Emergency Student Benefit scheme to help post-secondary students who have lost their opportunity for summer work but are left out of the CERB. Students will be eligible for $1,250 every month from May to August. Those who are taking care of someone else or who have a disability could receive $1,750. Students who are still working but earning less than $1,000 per month are still eligible, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. Trudeau said Ottawa is spending $291 million to extend scholarships, fellowships and grants for student researchers and graduate students to help them ""keep working."" The City of Vancouver is helping residents of the Downtown Eastside set up bank accounts so they don't have to collect or cash cheques in person come next Wednesday when income assistance cheques are paid out. With the help of Pigeon Park Savings and Vancity, residents are encouraged to sign up for bank accounts and the normal membership fees and ID requirements are waived. Nearly 200 new accounts have been opened in the past month, according to a City of Vancouver news release.  Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of  5 p.m. PT on Wednesday, Canada had 40,190 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases. A CBC News tally of COVID-19-related deaths, based on provincial and regional health data, as well as CBC's reporting, listed 2,074 coronavirus-related deaths in Canada.

On Thursday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced 29 new cases of the novel coronavirus, for a total of 1, 824. Those numbers include new outbreaks at a long-term care home in the Interior Health region, as well as two acute care centres. Outbreaks at 10 long-term care homes across the province have been declared over.  The province has now seen 94 people die of COVID-19, with the addition of four more deaths announced Thursday. There were 103 COVID-19 patients in hospital, down from a peak of 149 on April 4. Forty-four patients are currently being treated in intensive care.  Seventy-eight people have tested positive for the virus at Mission Institution, a federal prison. A total of 1,092 people have recovered from the disease. Another poultry plant is seeing staff infected with the virus. Two positive tests were confirmed at the Superior Poultry Plant in Coquitlam, a sister plant of United Poultry Plant in East Vancouver, where 29 people have tested positive.  Some people working in both places, said Henry. She expects there will likely be others in the new facility that are ill and will test positive.  Investigations are ongoing at both facilities. While British Columbians are starting to think about how society might slowly open up if the province continues to flatten the curve of infection, Henry said everyone needs to be very careful about how that happens. ""How do we live with it without getting ourselves into trouble?"" she said. ""A misstep in the wrong direction puts us all at risk."" As Health Minister Adrian Dix put it: ""We need to reboot B.C. without rebooting the virus."" Henry said while she would like to see no new cases for days and even weeks in a row, she recognizes the need to increase social and economic connections. But she was clear that won't happen unless there is ""a manageable number of new cases"" and appropriate measures in place to ensure the virus doesn't ""take off again.""  ""This is not forever. It is for now. Now may be months, it may be a year,"" she said. ""Now is not the time to tip the scales against us with careless action."" The province on Thursday said applications for the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers will open May 1. It is the tax-free, one-time $1,000 payment announced in March for B.C. residents whose ability to work has been affected due to COVID-19. To be eligible, applicants must also meet the eligibility requirements for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, among other criteria. A new emergency response centre is opening in Abbotsford to help those living on the streets and in shelters better mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The centre will have spaces to help with physical distancing, mobile showers and weekly meal service. Individuals will be referred to the centre by Fraser Health. The centre will be staffed 24/7 and can provide those in need with access to primary care, harm reduction and overdose prevention services.  It will be operated by the Lookout Housing and Health Society at the Bakerview Mennonite Brethren Church on Clearbrook Road.  Presales for the pink pumps named after the provincial health officer went online at 4 p.m. PT on Thursday, though the John Fluevog website was down during that time. It's unclear why.  Hold tight everyone! Our website is experiencing technical difficulties and we're working on it! Henry has been known to wear shoes by the Vancouver designer at press conferences, and said she was honoured to work with him on this pair for a good cause.  ""I think it's a wonderful thing and I'm really appreciative of the work that John Fluevog does in the community and of course he makes beautiful shoes,"" said Henry.  The shoes will retail for $339 Cdn with all proceeds going to Food Banks BC, a charity selected by Henry herself.  ""We know that it's been challenging for many people during this crisis to access food and food security has been even heightened for particularly people who are no longer employed, homeless or under housed, so to be able to support the food banks is very important to me."" The federal government announced Thursday it is spending $1.1 billion to help develop, test and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine. Most of the new money is set aside to fund vaccine development and clinical trials, but a portion of the money will also be used to determine how widely the virus has spread across the country. ""Until we have a vaccine or significant treatment, we're not going to be able to talk about getting back to normal,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild.

The latest figures, announced in a news release Friday afternoon, bring B.C.'s totals to 1,853 cases and 98 deaths. As of Friday afternoon, there were 96 COVID-19 patients in hospital, including 41 in critical care. A total of 1,114 people have recovered from the disease. While B.C.'s figures continue to suggest a flattening of the curve of infection, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry are urging people to stay the course on physical distancing and good hygiene to prevent further spread. ""As you get outside and safely spend time with loved ones, let's continue to stay strong and show care and compassion to those around us, by ensuring we do not undo all of our hard work and sacrifice,"" they said in Fridaynews release. There are now COVID-19 outbreaks at two poultry processing plants in Metro Vancouver. On Thursday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced that two cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed at Coquitlam's Superior Poultry plant. It's a sister facility to the United Poultry plant in Vancouver, where 35 cases have been confirmed as of Friday afternoon. Seventy-eight people have tested positive for the virus at Mission Institution, a federal prison, and there are currently active oubreaks at 20 long-term care homes and three acute-care units in B.C. The federal government on Friday announced a new aid program for struggling small businesses to help cover rent expenses. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance will offer forgivable loans to qualifying commercial property owners. It will cover 50 per cent of three monthly rent payments payable by eligible small business tenants experiencing financial hardship during April, May and June. The loans will be forgiven if the mortgaged property owner agrees to reduce the eligible tenant's rent by at least 75 per cent for the three corresponding months under a rent forgiveness agreement, which will include a pledge not to evict the tenant while the agreement is in place. Trudeau said the small business tenant would cover the remainder, up to 25 per cent of the rent.

On Saturday, Dr. Bonnie Henry announced 95 new cases, with 40 of them linked to the Mission Institution — where 106 inmates and 12 staff are sick — and 16 new cases at a Superior Poultry chicken processing plant in Coquitlam.  There were also 11 new cases linked to an outbreak at the Kearl Lake oilsands project in northern Alberta, for a total of 21 cases there. The number of patients in hospital remained steady at 96, with 41 people in critical care. The province has confirmed 1,948 cases, of which 1,137 have fully recovered. Henry announced two new deaths on Saturday, one of which is the first recorded fatality linked to a First Nations community in the province. Henry described the death of a First Nations elder as a tragedy.  To date, 100 people have died of COVID-19 in B.C. There are active outbreaks at 20 long-term care homes. Dr. Henry said on Saturday that an outbreak had ended at one facility. Also on Saturday, the province announced plans to place people living in encampments in Vancouver's Oppenheimer Park, along with Victoria's Topaz Park and Pandora corridor, in hotels. The province said they will be provided services to keep them safer during the pandemic. On Sunday, seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie said $500,000 in funding will go to the Family Caregivers of British Columbia, a non-profit that supports seniors and caregivers. The funding will expand the help line and expand the organization's virtual tool kit.  Mackenzie says there are hundreds of thousands of people in the province who provide support for seniors so they can remain at home, including at least 30,000 people who provide more intense care like bathing and feeding.  Many of the measures put in place to combat COVID-19 have inadvertently impeded many improvements made for seniors in the province, she said.  Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild.

Henry announced three new deaths on Monday, for a total of 103 deaths related to COVID-19 in B.C. Two Metro Vancouver poultry plants are at the centre of B.C.'s COVID-19 crisis after facility staff at both sites tested positive. Fraser Health announced Monday it has closed a poultry plant in Coquitlam following an outbreak among staff at the facility. So far, two employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and all employees have been screened. Fraser Health says there will be no recall of chicken products from this plant because there is no evidence to suggest that food is a likely source of transmission, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  The health authority, in a statement, also declared one long-term facility outbreak over, at Langley Lodge. It said there are no more COVID-19 cases at that site. Two new outbreaks were declared, however, at Valhaven Home and MSA Manor, both in Abbotsford. At Valhaven, the health authority said, a resident was diagnosed with the disease. At MSA, a staff member was diagnosed. Both are now in isolation at home, the statement said. On a call with reporters, Dr. Martin Lavoie, Fraser Health's chief medical health officer, said the authority was aware of a ""few"" situations where staff of long-term care homes were coming into work while showing mild symptoms of what could potentially be COVID-19. ""When we identify that, it is a gap in our measures,"" Lavoie said. ""It is important to only go to work if you're feeling well and that you have no symptoms whatsoever that could potentially be of COVID-19."" Lavoie would not provide details of where these situations occurred. Applications opened today for a $73-billion federal wage subsidy program to help businesses that have seen a drop in revenue due to COVID-19. The support program covers up to 75 per cent of wages for businesses affected by COVID-19. All-sized businesses, charities and non-profits are eligible if they have had a drop in revenue of at least 30 per cent. The subsidy is available for three months, retroactive to March 15, and provides up to $847 a week per employee.

Henry announced new numbers related to the pandemic Tuesday afternoon. In addition to the deaths, she said 55 new cases of the disease were detected in the past 24 hours, for a total of 2,053 infections province-wide. By Tuesday afternoon, 1,231 people had recovered. Henry announced no new outbreaks to announce at long-term care homes or assisted living facilities. There are currently 20 ongoing outbreaks at care homes and three in acute care units. In total, 34 cases have arisen from the outbreak at the United Poultry Plant in Vancouver and 46 have come from the outbreak at the Superior Poultry Plant in Coquitlam. At Mission Institution prison, two more inmates have tested positive. That brings the total infections connected to that outbreak to 120 inmates and 12 staff. The prospect of reopening parts of B.C. is starting to look more realistic in the not-so-distant future as the province continues to bend the curve of infection. ""We're getting close to that time where we can start to open up,"" provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Monday. No date has been set for any restrictions to be lifted, however, and officials have repeatedly said that any loosening up will require the number of active cases and hospitalizations to continue to fall. As of Monday, B.C. has confirmed a total of 1,998 cases of the novel coronavirus, and 103 people have died. Ninety-seven patients are in hospital, including 36 in intensive care, and 1,190 have fully recovered. There are active outbreaks at 21 long-term care homes and three hospital acute care units, along with two outbreaks connected to poultry processing plants in the Lower Mainland. A total of 118 people have tested positive for COVID-19 at Mission Institution, a federal prison, and there are 11 B.C. cases so far linked to an oubreak at the Kearl Lake oilsands project in northern Alberta.  On Tuesday morning, federal health officials provided updated projections on the number of potential cases and deaths in Canada from COVID-19, as debate ramps up across the country about when to ease restrictions on businesses and schools. New modelling shows that while the number of new cases was doubling every three days previously, it is now doubling every 16 days. Short-term projections forecast between 53,191 and 66,835 cases by May 5, and between 3,277 and 3,883 deaths by that date. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that new modelling shows public health measures are working to slow the spread of COVID-19 — but cautioned that easing restrictions too fast could wipe out the progress made to date. Food trucks are being set up in provincially owned locations throughout B.C. to support commercial truck drivers. The province said in a written statement that it is forgoing the usual restrictions and fees for food-truck operators who want to set up on key stops for drives. So far, vendors are operating at rest areas, weigh scales and other commercial truck pullouts throughout the Lower Mainland and southern Interior. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of Sunday, Canada had 48,500 confirmed COVID-19 cases. A CBC News tally of coronavirus-related deaths, which is based on provincial data, local public health information and CBC reporting, put the death toll at 2,817 in Canada, plus two deaths abroad. The numbers are not a complete picture, as they don't account for people who haven't been tested, those being investigated as a potential case and people still waiting for test results.  For a look at what's happening across the country and the world, check the CBC interactive case tracker.

In total, 2,087 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across the province. At least 1,305 people have fully recovered. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry confirmed that 109 people have died in total. The four most recent deaths were seniors inside long-term care homes. There are 24 outbreaks at care centres, the most recent being the Clayton Heights Care Home in Surrey. The virus has also re-emerged at the Langley Lodge. Workers from two more poultry-processing plants have tested positive for COVID-19. A positive case at the Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry near Chilliwack was confirmed by the company early Wednesday. Shortly after, Sofina Foods Inc. announced a worker from its Port Coquitlam chicken plant was also infected. Another 42 cases stem from the outbreak at the United Poultry plant in Vancouver and 50 have come from the outbreak at Superior Poultry Processors in Coquitlam. Investigatons at both sites are ongoing. At the Mission Institution prison, 120 inmates and 12 staff members have tested positive for the disease. The Ministry of Health will provide its next update at 3 p.m. on Thursday. B.C. Premier John Horgan  pointed to the ongoing outbreaks at poultry plants as a warning of what could happen if the economy is reopened too quickly and how rapidly COVID-19 can spread in the workplace. Horgan announced the province is extending its state of emergency by another two weeks. He said a reopening of the economy is coming, but in the meantime, British Columbians must remain vigilant. ""It's going to take resolute action by all of us to ensure that we continue to make progress, rather than give up the progress that has been so hard fought for in the last month and a half,"" he said. States of emergency can only be issued for two weeks at a time in B.C., meaning the latest will last through the end of day on May 12. The declaration gives the province extraordinary powers during a crisis, including the ability to restrict travel and set prices for essential goods like medical supplies and food. Horgan says next week the province will announce plans to ease restrictions and restore various sectors of the economy, similar to what other provinces have done. B.C. Housing announced it is moving people from large homeless encampments into secure housing. The move follows a sweeping plan by the province to move tent city residents in Victoria and Vancouver into hotels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Tuesday, 33 people from Oppenheimer Park have been relocated, as well as 41 people from Victoria's Topaz Park and Pandora corridor. ""The objective [is] to ensure that we put people in appropriate housing, give them three square meals a day and the other services they need,"" said Horgan. Restrictions on travel continue to have ripple effects in the economy. The Vancouver Airport Authority is reducing its workforce, noting that air traffic will be down for the foreseeable future and YVR will rebuild over the coming years. ""We're starting by offering voluntary departure packages to all employees which got underway today,"" said YVR communications manager Brock Penner in a written statement released Wednesday. Layoffs will follow in the coming days, according to the airport authority. The VAA employs about 500 people in areas including airport operations, finance and engineering. The province has also announced additional support for women and children experiencing violence during the COVID-19 pandemic amid reports that isolation has led to an increase in domestic violence  ""The province has secured nearly 300 additional spaces in communities throughout B.C. for people leaving violent or unstable situations, with more spaces to come,"" said Mitzi Dean, parliamentary secretary for gender equity, in a written statement.  ""These are in addition to more than 100 transition houses and safe homes that the province funds on an ongoing basis."" Anyone experiencing violence or abuse can access supports from VictimLinkBC by phone at 1-800-563-0808 or by email at VictimLinkBC@bc211.ca. Services are available 24/7 in multiple languages. A small group of MPs met in person in the House of Commons on Wednesday to debate legislation that would provide $9 billion in financial aid to post-secondary students during the pandemic. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the suite of benefits last week in response to critics claiming that too many young people were left out of other COVID-19 support programs.  Under the proposed new measures, students would be eligible for $1,250 a month from May through August. That sum can go up to $1,750 if the student is caring for a dependent or has a disability. The benefit is also available to students who have jobs but are making less than $1,000 a month.

Henry announced Thursday that 25 new cases of COVID-19 were detected within the last 24 hours in B.C. and two more people had died: a senior living in a long-term care home and a person who died in hospital in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Henry said new details about the province's path forward would be revealed by Premier John Horgan next week. In the meantime, she said, British Columbians need to remain ""champions"" of physical distancing, handwashing and staying connected at a distance to vulnerable people. ""Our lives, our businesses, our communities have dramatically changed in [the] last 100 days,"" Henry said. ""One thing really has stayed the same, and that is the unwavering commitment of everybody here in British Columbia to work together and to keep our firewall strong."" In all, B.C. has now confirmed 2,112 cases of COVID-19 and 111 people have died of the disease. As of Thursday afternoon, there were 82 patients in hospital, including 30 in intensive care. In all, 1,322 people have recovered. There are 21 active outbreaks at long-term care centres and three in acute care units of Lower Mainland hospitals. COVID-19 has been detected in 256 residents of long-term care homes and 153 staff. On Wednesday, Horgan announced that he is extending B.C.'s state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic for another two weeks. Terry Fox events will go ahead in September, but not in the way organizers predicted. Fred Fox, Terry Fox's older brother and manager of supporter relations for the Terry Fox Foundation, said Terry Fox runs across Canada will be ""virtual"" in 2020. Planning for the September fundraisers in communities across Canada would normally be getting underway in April and May, Fox said. Because physical distancing guidelines may still be in place in September, the foundation had to make crucial decisions now. ""It's going to be different. We're not going to be gathering in big groups,"" Fox said. ""People are still going to want to participate and support cancer research. ""Terry was an innovator... It was all about raising money for cancer research. Terry would be challenging us in this different time to be doing the same thing."" Details are not clear for what those runs will look like yet, Fox said, but could include participants walking or running in their communities or local parks. On Wednesday, positive cases were confirmed in workers at the Sofina Foods Lilydale plant in Port Coquitlam and Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry in Yarrow. That's in addition to 92 cases connected to oubreaks at Superior Poultry Processors in Coquitlam and United Poultry in Vancouver. The outbreaks among workers at four B.C. poultry plants have raised concerns about what supports are in place to keep employees from putting themselves and their co-workers at risk. Thursday morning, federal environment minister Jonathan Wilkinson said the government brought in the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to ensure that people don't have to go to work sick, but acknowledge that gaps still exist. According to Wilkinson, the federal government estimates it's already spent close to $25 billion in aid to Canadians affected by the crisis. The environment minister says the COVID-19 pandemic is also raising the need to address other crises, like climate change. ""We are going to have to reflect on how we continue to move forward to ensure [that] we are addressing our greenhouse gas emissions and working with our international partners to ensure that the world is addressing that,"" he said. ""There is a looming crisis that is coming at us down the train tracks and it is going to be something that is going to cause enormous economic and personal dislocation."" The lack of human activity due to physical distancing restrictions has led to a reduction in emissions around the world, but some worry that as provinces begin to move toward lifting restrictions and reopening the economy, it could lead to a sudden spike in emissions. Wilkinson believes that with advancements in renewable energy technologies, there is no need to see a spike in Canada. ""Renewable energy is increasingly cost competitive relative to other forms of energy,"" he said. ""There are all kinds of technological solutions that have been developed over the course of the past couple of decades that are ready and we are able to implement."" Premier John Horgan said in a news release the government will defer stumpage fees for the next three months to help forest companies with their financial liquidity during the crisis. Stumpage is the fee forest operators pay the province to harvest, buy or sell trees from Crown land. The government says the fee deferral leaves eligible companies with about $80 million to pay employees, contractors and other bills. B.C.'s forest industry was struggling prior to the pandemic. Hundreds of workers had been laid off and numerous mills had closed in the Interior due to high operating costs and low timber prices.

The man was in the Fraser Health region when he died, according to Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix. He is the 112th person in B.C. whose death is connected to COVID-19. As of Friday afternoon, 2,145 people have had confirmed cases of COVID-19 in B.C.  There are 79 people in hospital with the disease, including 24 in intensive care, and 1,357 people have recovered from their illnesses. Active outbreaks are underway at 21 long-term care homes and three hospital acute-care units, along with four poultry processing plants, and Mission Institution, a federal prison. Superior Poultry in Coquitlam has 52 employees who have tested positive for COVID-19 and United Poultry in Vancouver has 35 employees who have tested positive. The statement noted the number for United Poultry is lower than yesterday's number, which was in error. At Mission Institution, 133 inmates and staff are confirmed positive, according to the statement. There are 15 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta. B.C. is now accepting applications for its Emergency Benefit for Workers, which provides a one-time, tax free payment of $1,000 to those whose work has been affected by COVID-19. Minister of Finance Carole James says the province received more than 16,000 applications in the first hour of its opening. The province says the easiest way to apply is through its online portal. On Thursday, B.C.'s provincial health officer began dropping hints about opening up the social lives of British Columbians as the COVID-19 infection curve continues to flatten. During Thursday's daily briefing, Dr. Bonnie Henry said the next phase of B.C.'s pandemic response could include allowing people to meet outside with small groups of friends. ""We might be able to connect with others in a way that we haven't been able to do in a while, but we need to be thoughtful about it. The more groups and people we have connections with, the more chances are that we might be able to transmit this virus,"" she said. On Friday, the district of Fraser-Fort George opened its regional parks for day trips, but physical distancing guidelines must be followed, officials say. All 11 parks in the central B.C. region are open. Overnight camping is not allowed.

That brings the overall number of confirmed cases in B.C. to 2,224 and the death toll to 117. Henry also released new modelling for COVID-19 on Monday, as the province prepares to begin reopening the economy.  The data showed that more women than men have been diagnosed with the virus. However, more men than women have required critical care. The 50-59 age group has the highest number of confirmed cases but the majority of deaths are elderly people over 70. The provincial government is expected to outline its plan to relax the rules put in place to combat COVID-19 this week. CBC News has learned there are three key takeaways. First, nothing will ""reopen"" this week. Second, the changes won't take effect until the middle of May. Third, the government won't be releasing a lengthy list of which stores should open. Instead, there will be guidelines for industries that have voluntarily shut down since March. Overall, the focus will be on giving the public broad rules for how it can safely practise a ""new normal"" until a vaccine for COVID-19 is found.   TransLink on Monday announced it will begin charging bus fares again and allowing front-door boarding on June 1. Buses have been free and running on a rear-boarding only model since March 20. The transit authority said it is installing temporary plexiglass shields on conventional buses to shield drivers from passengers boarding through the front door. Vinyl barriers will be installed on the remainder of the fleet. ""We've managed to find an innovative solution which ensures the safety of our bus operators, while also allowing for safe fare collection,"" TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond wrote in a statement. The authority expects to collect $2 million per month in revenue after bringing fares back. TransLink previously said it was losing $75 million every month due to the pandemic, leading to nearly 1,500 layoffs and widespread cuts to most modes of public transportation in Metro Vancouver in late April. Broken down by health authority, there are 845 cases in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1027 in Fraser Health, 124 in Vancouver Island Health, 177 in Interior Health and 51 in Northern Health. Henry said the number of long-term care and acute care facilities with outbreaks remained steady at 23. The outbreak at the Mission Federal Institution continues to grow, now affecting 121 inmates and 13 staff members.  Of the three Lower Mainland poultry processing plant with outbreaks, Superior Poultry remains the largest with 54 cases. United Poultry has 34 and Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry seven confirmed cases.  Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 4:30 a.m. PT, Canada has recorded 59,474 presumptive and confirmed coronavirus cases. Provinces and territories listed 24,921 cases as recovered or resolved. A tally maintained by CBC News based on provincial health data, regional health information and CBC's reporting lists 3,774 coronavirus-related deaths in Canada, with two known COVID-19-linked deaths of Canadians abroad.

2020-05-05T22:35:13.047Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-may-5-1.5555366,"B.C. logged only eight new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours but four more people have died, bringing the total number of deaths to 121. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry made the announcement Tuesday afternoon. New outbreaks were also declared at North Vancouver's Evergreen House, a care home, and two acute care centres: Ridge Meadows Hospital and Richmond Hospital. There are 22 outbreaks in long-term care and assisted living facilities as of Tuesday. However, the outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre, one of the first care homes hit hard by the virus, is officially over. While B.C. has successfully ""put the brakes"" on the virus and reopening plans are set to be announced, ""we are not through this yet,"" warned Henry. ""So please don't start planning your play dates and expanding your bubble too soon."" Henry said Monday provincial authorities are working under the assumption that B.C. is currently around 30 per cent of regular interactions but that the virus can be kept in check if interactions are kept below 60 per cent going forward. The latest round of COVID-19 data for B.C., released Monday, revealed the spread of the virus has been declining since physical distancing measures were introduced and schools, restaurants and bars were closed in mid-March. Henry, along with Premier John Horgan and Health Minister Adrian Dix, are set to announce B.C.'s plans to begin easing restrictions on Wednesday.  CBC News has learned there are three key takeaways. Restrictions are not expected to change until at least mid-May. Overall, the focus will be on giving the public broad rules for how it can safely practise a ""new normal"" until a vaccine for COVID-19 is found. Safe ways to increase social and economic contacts will form the basics of the plan, but the public shouldn't necessarily expect a detailed list of what they can and cannot do. ""It's absolutely going to have to be a unique look at our own situations,"" said Henry, referring to the ""double your bubble"" concept. ""If we have people that are in our circle that are more at risk of having severe illness, particularly our seniors and elders, we need to take measures to protect them,"" she continued. As an example, Henry suggested people might be able to see a friend for dinner or take kids to visit grandparents, but they'll have to weigh risk and carefully decide whether it would be a safe choice. ""If my grandfather has heart disease ... or my grandmother is going through cancer treatment, we should think about whether we want to include them in our bubble,"" Henry said. ""For every person that we interact with, we're exposed to the people that they've interacted with. So, it's a concept that we're not making that bubble too big."" Henry said the numbers from Tuesday were further reason for hope but cautions moving forward too quickly could undo the sacrifices that have been made. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $252-million aid package Tuesday for Canada's agriculture and food industries. He said $77 million of that money will go to measures to keep workers in food processing safe with protective equipment and by supporting physical distancing in workplaces. Meat-packing plants, in particular, have seen large coronavirus outbreaks, including three poultry processors in B.C. Henry said on Tuesday, there were 55 confirmed positive cases at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35 at United Poultry in Vancouver. Seven cases were detected at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry. The plant was closed for three days but after implementing a plan to reduce the risk of the virus among employees, it has now reopened at a reduced capacity. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of 3:30 p.m. PT, Canada had 62,046 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19. Provinces and territories listed 27,006 of those as either recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally based on provincial data, regional health information and CBC's reporting put the COVID-19-related death toll in Canada at 4,166, plus two known deaths of Canadians abroad.

""This is not a return to normal,"" said Horgan, joined by B.C. top doctor Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix. ""This is a new normal."" The premier said the provincial restart will happen in phases, spaced out by two- to four-week time periods. It will start with allowing small gatherings, like backyard barbecues, as long as those participating aren't sick or showing any symptoms of COVID-19. The first round of eased restrictions will happen in time for the Victoria Day long weekend. It will also include the opening of some B.C. parks, while haircuts and elective surgeries might be available again within weeks. Restaurants and pubs will also be allowed to reopen over the next few weeks, as long as they are in compliance with physical distancing regulations. Horgan said the province is preparing for the full resumption of classroom learning come September. Horgan and health officials will expand on B.C.'s plan to perform surgeries put on hold during the pandemic at a news briefing scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Thursday.  The total number of positive cases recorded in B.C. rose to 2,255 on Wednesday. The three additional deaths occurred in long-term care centres. One was in the Island Health region and the other two were in Vancouver Coastal Health, according to the Ministry of Health. Nearly 1,500 people have recovered from the disease. Across B.C., 74 people with COVID-19 are in hospital, 19 of whom are in intensive care. School districts across B.C. are drafting plans to reopen with teachers returning to classrooms as early as May 11 in some parts of the province. Plans, however, vary widely by school district. Municipalities are also grappling with how best to move forward, with no timeline as to when COVID-19 will stop presenting a threat.   Horgan said there is no timeline on when large gatherings, like concerts and sporting events, will return. The priorities beginning in mid-May will include rebooting parts of the health-care system that have been idle, like dentistry, physiotherapy, chiropractic treatments, scheduled surgeries, outpatient services, diagnostic testing and imaging services. British Columbians can also expect the return of services like hair salons, retail stores, museums, libraries, restaurants, pubs, office-based workplaces, transit, sports leagues and child care. The goal, according to public health officials, is to allow for a return to about 60 per cent of normal interactions, without causing a surge in infections. In order to reopen, B.C. employers must have clear policies to make sure that anyone who has symptoms of a cold, the flu or COVID-19 does not go into work, provincial health officials said. Sick day policies have to be developed on the understanding that staff will stay home sick more often, the province says, and employers need to come up with plans to accommodate seniors and those with existing medical conditions. Thousands of British Columbians are currently out of work. Horgan said up to 400,000 residents have applied for the province's new emergency benefit. Horgan said there must be definitive evidence that the curve has flattened before land border crossings are opened up. Horgan also confirmed that he signed off on a proposal to host crowdless NHL games in B.C. as the league looks to resume play following a months-long hiatus. The document was sent to the league and to the NHL Players Association. ""Assuming that the games would be played without audiences, but instead would be played for television,"" Horgan stipulated. The Vancouver Canucks confirmed the team has put forward a proposal for Vancouver to be a ""hub city"" for NHL teams to play in during the COVID-19 pandemic if that's the approach the NHL decides to pursue. ""We would certainly have a strong interest in hosting games in Vancouver … provided the plan is in accordance with guidelines set by health authorities and the provincial government,"" wrote Canucks chief operating officer Trent Carroll in an email. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has also thrown her support behind the idea.

The province on Wednesday announced small gatherings with up to six people will be OK by next weekend. ""This is not a return to normal,"" said Horgan, joined by B.C.'s top doctor Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix at a Wednesday news conference. ""This is a new normal."" The premier said the provincial restart will happen in phases, spaced out by two- to four-week time periods. It will begin with allowing small gatherings, like backyard barbecues, as long as those participating aren't sick or showing any symptoms of COVID-19. Absent from the announcement was an official reopen date and an exhaustive list of hard-and-fast rules for what British Columbians can and cannot do under the new guidelines. The onus has been left on the public to collectively make choices that will limit regular interactions to below 60 per cent of normal and prevent a resurgence of the virus.  Minister Dix said British Columbians have proven they are capable of making the right decisions over the past two months. ""British Columbia has imposed fewer rules than other jurisdictions and British Columbians responded, I think, by following those rules to a great degree. The flattening of the curve we've seen so far is the success of everybody,"" he said Thursday. Dix warned everyone must still maintain physical distancing, wash their hands regularly and avoid touching their face even as they widen their circle of contacts. Anyone who feels the slightest bit unwell must not leave home. The federal government announced on Thursday a $4-billion program to top up the wages of essential workers. Provincial governments will contribute $1 billion of the funds and will be in charge of determining which workers receive the help. Dr. Bonnie Henry, during a Thursday afternoon briefing, said 33 new COVID-19 cases had been detected in the last 24 hours. That means in all, 2,288 people in B.C. have tested positive. Two more people have died: one in the Fraser Health region, another in Vancouver Coastal Health. In all, 126 people have died of COVID-19 in B.C. There are 76 patients in hospital with COVID-19, including 20 in intensive care. No new outbreaks in long-term care homes or acute-care units have been detected. There are 21 active outbreaks in those settings and 18 have been declared over. By Thursday, 1,512 people had recovered. The province estimates 30,000 non-urgent scheduled surgeries were either postponed or not scheduled in B.C. due to the COVID-19 crisis. Another 24,000 people could be without a referral to get on a wait list. ""But because of those sacrifices, we can move forward,"" Horgan said Thursday. ""[Those patients] have been living in pain. Today we will start the process of relieving that pain."" Postponed elective surgery patients will be contacted in coming days. Surgeries are set to resume by May 18. Getting surgeries back on track will require new operating rooms and new staff, including surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists. Catching up with all those procedures could take two years and cost at least $250 million in extra funding, the province said Thursday. READ MORE: How B.C. plans to ease COVID-19 restrictions Some aspects of life with COVID-19 will not be changing soon, Horgan added. Large gatherings likely won't be possible until a vaccine is developed, which health officials have said could take up to 18 months. Non-essential travel plans, including travel within B.C., should be shelved for now as well, the premier said. At Vancouver's Oppenheimer Park, over 175 tent city residents have been moved into shelter spaces secured in hotels and community centres. There are still people who need to be moved, however, after the province established a May 9 deadline to empty the park of campers over concerns of COVID-19 transmission. Tanya Fader with the Portland Hotel Society said most people are willing to leave. ""At the end of the day, if somebody chooses not to leave, that's their own personal autonomy and that's their own personal decision,"" said Fader. ""We're not here to force anybody out."" The province has said if residents of Oppenheimer Park and Victoria's Topaz Park and Pandora corridor have not left by May 9, enforcement could follow. At a briefing Thursday afternoon, Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said he was planning to poll residents and meet with leaders of various industries in the city to determine the city's next steps. Many of the city's workplaces are provincially regulated, like bars, nightclubs and restaurants, but he said he wanted to have input from owners of those businesses to take forward to the province. ""We are in a new normal and we need to think differently if we are to succeed,"" Stewart said. Stewart says the city will embark on a new round of public opinion polling to help guide decisions, including around when and how the city reopens its community facilities. Libraries, non-essential community centres, playgrounds and outdoor recreation facilities like tennis courts have been shut down for more than six weeks in Vancouver and similar closures have taken place across B.C. communities. If no one is ready to visit those facilities, Stewart said, it doesn't make sense to open them. He said outdoor facilities will likely be the first to reopen. Stewart said he is meeting with representatives from the film and TV production industry Thursday afternoon. He added he plans to bring forward a council motion Tuesday to help speed up development applications. Stewart suggested his proposal could cut several months from the building application process for experienced developers.

Henry said on Friday that 73 people remain in hospital for treatment, 20 are in intensive care. Two cases were removed from the total number of cases recorded in the Island Health region due to a data error. The provincial total on Thursday was 2,286. On Friday it was 2,315. She said the province had flattened the curve of infections, but asked residents to keep up efforts to maintain physical distancing, even as restrictions lift. ""We must continue with what we have been doing, because it is working,"" she said in a statement. ""We have flattened our curve and must keep it there.""

The provincial unemployment rate now sits at 11.5 per cent, up from 5.5 per cent at the start of the year.  Finance Minister Carole James says the numbers are staggering, and emblematic of the crisis that has hit the entire country during COVID-19. Nearly half the job losses — 47 per cent — are in the food service and retail sectors.  In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the emergency wage subsidy program will be extended past June, with details to be released next week.  The federal government announced on Thursday a $4-billion program to top up the wages of essential workers.

The provincial government originally set Saturday as a deadline for campers to be out of Vancouver's Oppenheimer Park as well as Topaz and Pandora parks in Victoria. On Friday afternoon, Social Development Minister Shane Simpson said the province has worked to ensure those living in Oppenheimer Park are moved into temporary accommodations by May 9. However, he said the mainly non-profit organizations offering the accommodations asked for more time to prepare for residents of Topaz and Pandora parks. As of May 7, more than 320 campers in Vancouver and Victoria had been moved to local hotels by the provincial government. On Friday several municipalities announced plans to open outdoor tennis courts and other similar facilities for the weekend, but with rules on how people could use them. The premier has said the provincial restart will happen in phases, spaced out in two- to four-week time periods. It will begin with allowing small gatherings, like backyard barbecues, as long as those participating aren't sick or showing any symptoms of COVID-19. Absent from the announcement was an official reopening date and an exhaustive list of hard-and-fast rules for what British Columbians can and cannot do under the new guidelines. The onus has been left on the public to collectively make choices that will limit regular interactions to below 60 per cent of normal and prevent a resurgence of the virus.  British Columbians could be dining out at restaurants starting June 1, but reduced capacity and physical barriers mean it'll be a different experience than what we're used to. READ MORE: How B.C. plans to ease COVID-19 restrictions At a briefing Thursday afternoon, Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said he plans to poll residents and meet with leaders of various industries in the city to determine how to reopen community facilities. Libraries, non-essential community centres, playgrounds and outdoor recreation facilities like tennis courts have been shut down for more than six weeks in Vancouver and similar closures have taken place across B.C. communities. Some Vancouver gym owners say they're in no rush to reopen fitness studios and are looking at measures to minimize risk, including reducing class sizes and increasing cleaning. Meantime, the province said it could take up to two years and at least $250 million in extra funding to address the extensive backlog of elective surgeries postponed in B.C. since the peak of the pandemic. Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild. As of Friday, Canada had 66,434 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19. A CBC News tally of COVID-19-related deaths based on provincial figures, regional health data and CBC's reporting listed 4,678 deaths in Canada, with another two abroad.

Visits by family members, other than end-of-life visits, have been severely restricted at seniors residences since March, when Vancouver-area facilities began to see COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths. ""We are working, absolutely, on plans to make sure that we can let families back in to support our seniors and elders but in a safe way so that it is safe for the whole community within that facility,"" Henry said at a news conference. ""These new ways of doing things will be coming in the coming weeks and days."" But Henry said restrictions on visits must remain in place for the near future to limit the spread of the virus. She said there are currently 21 COVID-19 outbreaks at B.C. long-term care residences and acute-care units. There are 16 outbreaks at seniors residences and five at acute-care units. Outbreaks at 19 seniors residences have been declared over, Henry said. The next update from the province will be Monday at 3 p.m. Henry announced 15 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, as British Columbia moves closer to lifting restrictions.  She also announced two more deaths from COVID-19. To date, 129 people have died from the virus in the province, while among those who have tested positive, 1,659 people have recovered.

Henry has asked residents to keep up efforts to maintain physical distancing, even as restrictions begin to lift. She warned that despite her encouragement for people to get outside, people should still stick to their families and keep a safe distance from others.  Some tennis courts in Vancouver, along with those in other Metro Vancouver municipalities, are open this weekend as municipalities across Metro Vancouver lift restrictions put in place in March due to the COVID-19 crisis. Other outdoor facilities such as skate parks and even some basketball courts have opened as well, but there are rules for getting out to play, however.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Monday there have been 23 new cases of COVID-19 detected in B.C. since Saturday.  In that time, one more person has died. As of Monday, there were 2,353 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province. So far, 130 people have died and 1,719 people have recovered from the illness. There are 66 COVID-19 patients in hospital; 18 of them are in intensive care.

Travel into Yukon via highways 97 and 37 is limited to essential travel.  Many families spent the weekend in B.C. celebrating mothers on Mother's Day and the provincial health officer encouraged those visits to take place outside, where the risk of transmitting coronavirus is reduced. Meanwhile, debate was sparked online about whether busy beaches and parks were too busy, with the Vancouver Park Board encouraging people to go to a venue close to their home, rather than one of the more-crowded destination beaches.  The Vancouver Park Board has decided to extend the closure of parking lots at beaches and parks in the city.  The board says its staff observed large groups gathering on its beaches over the weekend with many failing to practise proper physical distancing. It says park rangers issued 1,880 warnings.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Tuesday there had been seven new cases of COVID-19 detected in B.C. in the last day. In that time, one more person has died. There are now 63 COVID-19 patients in hospital; 16 of them are in intensive care. There have been 2,360 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province to date. So far, 131 people have died and 1,832 people have recovered from the illness. During a record-breaking warm weekend, social media was awash with British Columbians concerned not everyone was following the rules of physical distancing. But on Monday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said she was largely satisfied with how most people conducted themselves. ""I had the pleasure of getting outside a few times myself this weekend and I did see lots of people,"" Henry said. ""The vast majority of them were in small groups, sitting apart ... The vast majority of people are doing the right thing and taking this to heart."" WATCH | Dr. Bonnie Henry explains why she believes the province's ""positive"" approach to physical distancing is working: However, with a long weekend approaching, both Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix are encouraging people to stay close to home and avoid unnecessary travel. ""Stay apart, stay local, stay safe,"" Dix said. ""We can't let up."" As the province moves closer to its first phase of reopening, Harbour Air announced Tuesday it has resumed daily flights between Vancouver, Victoria, Nanaimo, Sechelt and Salt Spring Island. The company suspended flights in early April.A statement said vigilant cleaning and physical distancing protocols are in place for flights going forward, including a requirement for passengers to wear masks and gloves while inside the terminal and on board planes. Fort St. John School District 60, meanwhile, has decided to reopen its school playgrounds.   In a Facebook post announcing its plan, the district asked the community to follow recommendations made by Dr. Bonnie Henry. Playground equipment will not undergo any sort of cleaning regimen and will be used at the public's own risk. School District 60 is comprised of 22 schools spread across the communities of Fort St. John, Taylor, Charlie Lake and Baldonnel.

Despite 1,880 warnings issued by Vancouver park rangers over the weekend, Henry said, by and large, British Columbians are getting the message about physical distancing.

At her Thursday briefing, Henry reported 15 new cases of COVID-19 detected in B.C. Three more people have died. Fifty-eight people are in hospital with the virus, 12 in intensive care. There have been 2,392 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in B.C. to date. So far, 135 people have died and 1,885 people have recovered. Provincial parks are reopening today, the first of a handful of restrictions to ease over the next few days as B.C. continues to record only a handful of new COVID-19 cases daily.  B.C. Parks is set to reopen facilities like front and backcountry trails, beaches, picnic areas, washroom facilities and boat launches for day use. Campgrounds are set to reopen June 1.  The change isn't meant to encourage British Columbians to travel outside of their communities, however. Health Minister Adrian Dix says any travel this weekend should only be for essential purposes. The federal government is also poised to announce a gradual reopening of national parks and heritage sites. However, during his daily briefing on Thursday morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said they would not reopen in time for the long weekend.  Trudeau also announced $470 million for the Fish Harvesters Benefit to support fish harvesters affected by the pandemic.  Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening, Vancouver city councillors passed a motion for staff to explore ways to ease restrictions for patios in order to help restore business for restaurants and breweries while maintaining physical distancing rules.  A poll commissioned by the City of Vancouver shows 84 per cent of respondents say they paid their rent this month, a 14 per cent increase from the start of April.  Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart attributed the increase to provincial and federal relief programs.  As for homeowners, 78 per cent said they intended to pay their full property tax, a 13 per cent increase from April. Vancouver lost 90,000 jobs, or 22 per cent of its entire workforce, since the pandemic began. More than 13,000 businesses have closed, a number Stewart called ""staggering."" As restrictions begin to loosen, women and people over the age of 55 reported feeling less comfortable returning to businesses like salons, restaurants and gyms without regular cleaning.  The city is looking at a shortfall of between $110 to $330 million depending how long closures last and whether property taxes are paid, Stewart said.  ""While the situation looks a little better in the city … it's still a very serious situation,"" Stewart said.  Dental offices will not be offering full services on May 19, according to a statement from the B.C. Dental Association (BCDA). Instead, the association says services including hygiene care will be introduced gradually when it's deemed safe. The BCDA says WorkSafeBC and public health officials have begun to develop guidelines for various sectors to extend services, including dentistry, but those guidelines have not yet been published.  Dental offices have been limited to emergency care since March 23.  ""Dental patients should contact their dentist to schedule an appointment, but please understand that until further direction is provided by the provincial health officer and the College of Dental Surgeons of B.C., dentists are only permitted to provide emergency and urgent services,"" BCDA spokesman Dr. Alastair Nicoll said in a statement.  On Thursday morning, Attorney General David Eby said ICBC, the provincial auto insurer, has no financial buffer. He said it is in a ""challenging position"" because of the pandemic and faces an uncertain future.  A decrease in collision claims resulted in a savings of around $158 million for ICBC, but claims are expected to rise again as more vehicles return to the roads.  More than 150,000 customers changed or cancelled their insurance policies, while the value of ICBC's investment portfolio has decreased due to the pandemic. The financial impact could be more than $1 billion in the 2020-2021 fiscal year, Eby said.  The province is reserving any decisions about premium changes or rebates until the end of the year, Eby said.  ""What we're seeing is uncertainty,"" he said. ""We simply don't know how the year will end. It could be terrible or there could be a surplus."" ICBC has temporarily waived some fees amid the pandemic and drivers can renew their insurance by phone. Drivers who choose to suspend their insurance won't have to pay the usual $30 cancellation and $18 re-plating fees.  As communities across the province prepare for the ""new normal"" of next week's Phase 2 pandemic response, B.C.'s provincial health officer is reminding people to keep their distance, even as restrictions ease. ""The path really is not black and white,"" Dr. Bonnie Henry said Wednesday. ""We've never done this before and we all need to try and do our best within the important guidance that we have around the key measures to keep us safe."" B.C.'s top doctor says the provincial order limiting public gatherings to 50 people or less will remain in place for the forseeable future, while small groups will be allowed to meet up after the long weekend.

Nurses' Union says it's concerned about the outbreak there, especially given that the facility is one of a few dedicated to treating the illness.  But Henry addressed those concerns at her daily briefing on Saturday, saying that shortage of personal protective equipment is not the issue there.  ""This outbreak reminds us of how pernicious this virus is,"" she said.  Henry also referred to the province's plans to reopen some sections of the economy starting on Tuesday.  On Friday, WorkSafeBC announced protocols for businesses in many sectors that are getting the green light to reopen: restaurants, cafés and pubs, real estate, arts and cultural facilities, retail, K-12 education, parks and outdoor spaces, health services, in-person counselling and office space. ""Some of the same rules for social interaction apply to our small businesse as well,"" Henry said. ""Fewer faces, less time together, bigger spaces."" For some smaller shops, restaurants and services reopening may not be possible given the new guidelines, Henry said. The Victoria Day long weekend normally signals the start of summer, but officials want British Columbians to make sure people don't let up on their efforts to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. While many provincial parks are now open for day use, officials are discouraging unnecessary travel. The mayor of Clearwater, near Wells Provincial Park, has raised concerns around provincial parks reopening last week. He worries contact tracing would be impossible in the event of outbreak in a park.  Officials are telling people to get outside, but to do it close to home.

Henry also reported three new deaths. Those figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 2,446. Henry said 325 of those cases are active, with 45 people in hospital and 12 in critical or intensive care. The province's death toll, meanwhile, stands at 146. The reduced spread comes as businesses and services around the province reopen, with guidelines from the Ministry of Health and WorkSafe B.C. ""I want to reassure you that we would not be easing these restrictions if we did not feel we could do so safely"" said Henry. ""We will do it safely, slow and together."" Later on Tuesday, the City of Vancouver rescinded an order that ended all table service in restaurants to allow them to reopen under the new provincial guidelines. The city is also accepting applications for temporary patio permits to provide more outdoor dining options. Safe reopening proved to be the focal point of Tuesday's update, with the Provincial Health Officer indicating more guidance could be expected in the coming days. Businesses need to have a COVID-19 safety plan in place before reopening, and it must be accessible to customers, employees and public health officials. Henry warned Monday that the province could see a flare-up in cases as things enter the so-called 'new normal'. ""For many the transition brings anticipation — but it also brings further apprehension and anxiety as schools and businesses look to open once again,"" she said. ""We are still learning the new ways of safe social interactions and doing things we've never had to do before. And that itself can cause new anxiety and concern."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday the Canada-U.S. border closure will be extended until June 21. He said both countries agreed to extend the closure to ""keep people in both our countries safe."" The current agreement banning all but essential traffic and goods was due to expire on Thursday.  Health officials in B.C. have been adamant about the need for the border to remain closed to prevent the virus being spread over the border.

The latest numbers, released Wednesday afternoon, bring the total to date to 2,467 confirmed cases, including 149 deaths and 2,001 recoveries. Right now, 43 people are in hospital with COVID-19, including 10 in intensive care. There are active outbreaks at 15 long-term care and assisted-living facilities in B.C. and three in hospital acute care units. Earlier Wednesday, Premier John Horgan took time in a news conference to speak out strongly against the rise in racism that has seemingly been triggered by the conronavirus outbreak. ""Hate has no place in British Columbia,"" he said. ""We are a strong and vibrant community because of the diversity that makes up this great province."" In a wide ranging address, Horgan also said he remains hopeful the NHL will choose Vancouver and possibly other B.C. hockey towns when the league starts up again in a modified format.  ""The Canucks are 100 per cent behind getting the hub city underway,"" he said. ""If you have to spend a couple of months in one place for the summer, Vancouver would be the place to do it."" Canada's chief public health officer on Wednesday said Canadians should wear a face mask as an ""added layer of protection"" whenever physical distancing is a challenge. ""For the spring and summer months, strict adherence to the public health basics of physical distancing, handwashing and cough etiquette must continue as the bare minimum,"" Dr. Theresa Tam said during a news conference. ""In addition, where COVID-19 activity is occurring, use of non-medical masks or face coverings is recommended as an added layer of protection when physical distancing is difficult to maintain. And staying home when sick is a must, always and everywhere."" B.C. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said non-medical masks can be helpful for short periods of time to prevent the wearer from spreading any illness to others, but emphasized masks do not replace other measures aimed at maintaining distance and separation between people. At the provincial level, some B.C. businesses that have been closed for two months are slowly starting to reopen as the province enters the second phase of its pandemic response. The transition comes as B.C. continues to flatten the curve of infection. Meanwhile, earlier this week, the federal government announced that the closure of the U.S.-Canada border to non-essential travel will be extended until June 21.

""But you know what? We've never had a pandemic in recorded history that has not had a second wave."" More than 2,000 people have now recovered from COVID-19 in B.C., accounting for more than 80 per cent of confirmed cases to date. As of Thursday, the province has recorded 2,479 cases of the novel coronavirus and 152 deaths. Forty-three COVID-19 patients are in hospital, including eight in intensive care. With 2,020 recoveries from the disease, B.C. has a total of 307 active cases. There are active outbreaks at 14 long-term care and assisted-living facilities and three in hospital acute care units. Henry said health officials have confirmed a new community outbreak at Mountain Institution, a federal prison in Agassiz, where one inmate has tested positive for the novel coronavirus shortly after transferring from Matsqui Institution in Abbotsford. Meanwhile, the outbreak at the United Poultry processing plant in Vancouver has been declared over. The province has entered its second phase of its restart plan. Provincial campsites will open up on June 1, but on Thursday BC Parks said the sites will be closed to non-B.C. residents. People from outside B.C. who already have reservations should call before June 15 to cancel and receive a full refund. Meanwhile, several more large events have been cancelled. Organizers of the popular GranFondo bike races have officially called off events in Whistler and Vancouver this year, citing the province's ban on mass gatherings. Mass gatherings fall into the province's Phase 4 and won't be permitted in B.C. until there is a successful treatment, vaccine or herd immunity. The federal government said Thursday it will provide $75 million for organizations that address the ""critical needs"" of Indigenous people living in urban centres and off reserve. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the additional funding for community groups that help Indigenous people with everything from groceries and mental health services to computers so kids can keep up with their school work. It comes on top of $15 million announced in March for these groups. Meanwhile, Premier John Horgan called out those responsible for a rise in anti-Asian racism during the the conronavirus pandemic. ""Hate has no place in British Columbia,"" he said at a press conference Wednesday. ""We are a strong and vibrant community because of the diversity that makes up this great province.""

Friday's update brings B.C.'s total to date to 2,507 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 155 deaths. A total of 2,042 people have recovered from their illnesses, bringing the number of active cases down to 310. There are now 41 COVID-19 patients in B.C. hospitals, including eight in intensive care. In a written statement, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Adrian Dix announced a new amendment on the order banning gatherings of more than 50. Any drive-in gatherings are now limited to 50 vehicles, with a restriction on sales of food and drinks. ""Anyone attending these events must stay in their cars unless they have to go to washrooms, which must be serviced with running water for proper hand hygiene,"" Henry and Dix said. The total number of confirmed cases released on Friday includes 10 people who were infected in Alberta in connection with the outbreak at the Kearl Lake oilsands project and self-isolated there before returning home to B.C. Those cases had not previously been including in B.C.'s numbers. Also on Friday, Fraser Health announced that a new outbreak has been detected at Nature's Touch, a frozen fruit processing plant in Abbotsford. Five workers have tested positive for COVID-19, and the company has temporarily closed the facility. Earlier Friday, the federal government announced it will fund provinces' efforts to test people for COVID-19, track the contacts of those who test positive and help different jurisdictions share data. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the measures are essential because COVID-19 remains a serious health threat, and the economy can't fully recover until Canadians are confident that the novel coronavirus that causes the illness will be contained anywhere new it breaks out. Speaking from Ottawa, Trudeau said federal contact tracers are helping public health authorities in Ontario and are ready to make thousands more calls a day when any other province asks. B.C. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said this week that testing will continue to be crucial as the country reopens its economy, particularly when the flu returns in the fall. She said contact tracing for diagnosed cases will also play a role, but added surveillance systems, such as those launched in China and Hong Kong, are ""probably not that helpful.""  ""That one-on-one public health investigation is incredibly important, so if there [are] some applications that help us do that more efficiently, then that's what we're looking for,"" Henry said. While B.C. may have flattened the curve of infection for now, health officials are urging British Columbians to take personal responsibility for protecting their communities from COVID-19. During Thursday's daily briefing, Health Minister Adrian Dix urged people to follow provincial recommendations on physical distancing and hygiene as businesses and services begin to open up again. ""These small actions … are what we owe to one another to help prevent the spread of the virus,"" Dix said. ""It's not a question of rights, but a question of our obligations as human beings to one another during an extraordinarily difficult time."" The province announced Friday it will allow food and alcohol-oriented businesses, like restauarants, breweries and distilleries, to expand their patio space in order to accommodate customers while keeping in line with physical distancing. The Vancouver Park Board said it is starting to reopen most parking lots at parks and beaches across the city. The board is looking to have them open by Sunday.  ""Parking at beaches and parks is also vital to ensure there is equity of access to these spaces, particularly for residents with mobility challenges,"" a statement read. Pay parking and enforcement will be in effect at the pay lots. Parking will remain temporarily closed at lots in Stanley Park and English Bay as roads in the area are still closed to vehicle traffic, including along Beach Avenue.  READ MORE:  Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild.

Some restaurants and hair salons have opened in the past week under strict new guidelines about physical distancing and hygiene, while more health-care services are becoming available. Among the first to see their hair stylist was Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, who said Saturday during a press briefing that she had her hair done recently while following all the health guidelines, including wearing a mask.  Henry said she has been pleased so far to see people visiting local businesses, including restaurants, while maintaining physical distance.  ""I thought it was really exciting. I was out for a walk last night and people were following the rules. I think things are going mostly really well,"" she said.  As of Saturday, there have been 2,517 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 157 deaths. A total of 2,057 people have recovered from their illnesses, bringing the number of active cases to 303. There are now 39 COVID-19 patients in B.C. hospitals, including eight in intensive care. Henry said that during the earliest days of B.C.'s contact tracing, a few infected people interacted closely with up to hundred people — or more. Since physical distancing measures were introduced, the average number of contacts came down from between six and eight, to three. ""In public health it gives us that fighting chance to find people quickly, in case they need health care, before they transmit it to someone else,"" she said.  Henry said that ""several hundreds"" of people are currently working as contact tracers in the Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health regions, with fewer in the less populated regions.

Henry says ""meticulous follow-up"" is needed if and when the border between the United States and Canada is reopened to ensure anyone with COVID-19 isn't passing the illness on to others. She says discussions are expected to be held with her federal counterparts on how that could be done with help from Ottawa. Henry says the province is beefing up public health teams this summer to keep up with COVID-19 testing, contact tracing and tracking because more cases are probable in the fall with the arrival of seasonal respiratory illnesses. There will be no update of provincial COVID-19 numbers Sunday. Henry's next update will be Monday at 3 p.m. PT. On Saturday she announced 10 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 2,517, including 2,057 patients who have recovered. The province also recorded two more deaths, totalling 157 fatalities. Henry encouraged people to keep gatherings small as the weather improves to prevent outbreaks and enable public health officials to quickly find those who may have become infected. An easing of restrictions in some countries has led to large outbreaks, such as in South Korea, where one person spread the illness to thousands of people, including those who had been to a night club, she noted. ""As we're opening up more settings we need to be more vigilant."" Henry has advised against international travel but said she will be encouraging British Columbians to travel locally and support businesses close to home this summer, ""if we're mindful of the potential for outbreaks."" However, she said many small communities may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, including First Nations, which could face greater losses during an outbreak. ""I would leave it to them to determine whether it is safe for people to travel to their communities. It's up to them to determine when they're ready for that, if at all this summer. And it may be that some areas will not be appropriate for us to visit unless we're invited in.""

Dr. Bonnie Henry said Saturday that travel within the province can happen only if the number of COVID-19 cases doesn't ramp up as restrictions on gatherings are eased. She said many small communities may not want people coming in, including some First Nations that could be more vulnerable to illness. Henry said she'll leave it to those communities to decide for themselves if it's safe for people to visit, so it's best to wait for an invitation. Henry also said over the weekend that the province's robust public health teams are being beefed up this summer to do more contact tracing. Henry said there will probably be an increase in COVID-19 cases this fall, along with the usual respiratory illnesses seen every year. She said retired doctors and nurses as well as medical students are among the people on public health teams in each health authority. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday morning that he'll push the provinces to give workers 10 days of paid sick leave a year as the country deals with the pandemic. That appears to meet a key demand from NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, in exchange for the New Democrats' support for a motion to limit sittings and votes in the House of Commons through the summer. Trudeau said the Liberals will also work on other long-term measures to make it easier for workers to stay home when they're ill. ""Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills,"" Trudeau said. Canada's commercial rent relief program opened for applications Monday morning. The Canada emergency commercial rent assistance (CECRA) program aims to reduce the rent owed by small businesses tenants by 75 per cent for April, May and June. Applications are staggered depending on the province where the property owner is located and the number of tenants, beginning Monday with those in Atlantic Canada, British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec with up to 10 tenants who are eligible for the program. Landlords in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and the Northwest Territories can apply Tuesday. Landlords with more than 10 eligible tenants can apply later this week. Struggling businesses, however, say the relief will benefit few of them.  There was no Sunday update of provincial COVID-19 numbers. Henry's next update will be Monday at 3 p.m. PT.

This coming week, she said, will be closely monitored and new data will be shared next week to help understand where B.C. stands in terms of its reopening.

The province also recorded four more deaths. All were residents of long-term care facilities. Their deaths bring the total to 161.

A total of 2,558 people have now had confirmed cases of COVID-19 in B.C., including 164 who died from their illness. To date, 2,153 people have recovered, leaving 241 active cases across B.C. Of those patients, 33 are in hospital, including six in intensive care. Meanwhile, B.C. is forging ahead with its efforts to restart the province and manage the economy, while local governments reopen city services bit by bit. The provincial government on Thursday announced a new job portal in an effort to find thousands of agricultural workers to deal with a major employee shortage created by the pandemic. Officials said there could be a backlog in local food production if 6,000 to 8,000 positions are not filled. The new portal is an attempt to match potential workers with farmers. On Wednesday, Premier John Horgan extended B.C.'s state of emergency by another two weeks, making it the longest in the province's history. At a more local level, TransLink announced it would be increasing capacity on buses, so vehicles will now be at two-thirds capacity before being deemed full. The transit authority stopped loading buses to full capacity in March to avoid crowding on board. Meanwhile, a number of municipalities in Metro Vancouver, including Vancouver, Surrey, Delta and the Tri-Cities, have announced playgrounds will be reopening in June. After weeks of decline in the numbers of active cases of COVID-19 as well as the hospitalization rate, health officials are asking British Columbians to stick with physical distancing efforts. It's been a week since some B.C. businesses began restarting operations as the province enters Phase 2 of the pandemic response. In a statement Wednesday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said they should have a better idea of how that's affected the spread of the coronavirus by mid-June. ""Let's continue to take advantage of parks and other activities closer to home and look to increase social interactions only after fully considering the risks to you and your family,"" the written statement said. ""This slow and thoughtful approach is our 'new normal.' It is grounded in what we know about COVID-19 today and will continue to be adapted as we learn more in the weeks and months ahead."" READ MORE:  ICBC hasn't been holding road tests for two months. Some say the test suspension is putting their careers on hold. Why has B.C.'s containment and recovery from COVID-19 been smoother than in Ontario? Epidemiologists say there are likely a number of reasons. Businesses in Vancouver's Granville Street Entertainment District are struggling and some have gone under, but there are hopes the neighbourhood can regain its momentum. Passenger traffic has plummeted at airports throughout B.C.'s Interior — Kamloops, Kelowna and Prince George's all saw drops of at least 96 per cent in April compared to 2019.  B.C. families are urging the province to speed up its plan to reunite family members with loved ones inside long-term care homes.  Some popular provincial parks are set to reopen next week, albeit with restrictions in line with Phase 2 of B.C.'s COVID-19 response. As the weather warms and people flock to the ocean, some are questioning the safety of Vancouver beaches with lifeguards still sidelined because of COVID-19 concerns. The Vancouver Canucks are considering moving a three-week training camp to the United States as managers lose confidence that a Canadian city will be selected as an NHL playoff hub.

Provincial health officials announced only four new cases on Friday. No deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. There are still 228 active cases in B.C. Thirty-four people remain in hospital, six of them in intensive care. A total of 2,562 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the province and 164 people have died. The federal government has extended a ban on large cruise ships docking at any Canadian ports until at least Oct. 31. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said any ship with overnight accommodations carrying more than 100 people will be not be allowed to operate in Canadian waters. In March, Ottawa initially banned cruise ships carrying more than 500 passengers until July 1.  The extension is another blow to the tourism sectors in Metro Vancouver and Greater Victoria, which brought in around $840 million and $130 million, respectively, during recent cruise ship seasons. Earlier this month, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said cruise ship passengers would not be permitted to disembark in B.C. even if the ships were allowed to dock at the province's ports. Officials continue to be concerned about the impact of the pandemic on the elderly and care home residents, and specialized response teams have been sent in to deal with outbreaks at two facilities in the Fraser Health region. On Thursday, Henry announced the outbreak of COVID-19 at Mission Institution — one of the largest outbreaks in B.C. — has been declared over. A total of 120 inmates and several correctional officers tested positive and one inmate died in the outbreak at the federal prison. Earlier this week, the Provincial Court of B.C. announced the next phase of service resumption, with limited courtrooms set to open next month for in-person appearances dealing with priority matters that can't be handled remotely. Friday, the court specified that traffic, ticket and bylaw appearances scheduled between March 18 and June 12 remain adjourned and will be rescheduled. Notices of new appearance dates will be sent to disputants by mail. Disputants will have the option to file a written request for a fine reduction or time to pay, or simply to pay the fine on the ticket. The deadline for payment has been extended to June 30.  READ MORE:  Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild.

Henry also pushed back over concerns about a rise in COVID-19 cases among children as schools reopen, saying the province knows how to manage those cases. People across the province may notice a few other changes this week as the spread of COVID-19 remains relatively subdued in B.C. compared to some other provinces in Canada. British Columbia's lowest paid workers get a pay increase Monday with a scheduled minimum wage hike at a crucial time for small businesses as they look for ways to continue operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase is part of the government's pledge to implement a $15 per hour minimum wage by next year after a decade of no increases from 2001 to 2011. The minimum wage jumps by 75 cents to $14.60 an hour on Monday. In Metro Vancouver, TransLink will start charging for buses again on Monday — the same day buses will start running at up to two-thirds capacity.  For the third time this week, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said on Saturday there were no new deaths caused by COVID-19.  Henry announced 11 new cases yesterday, bringing the province's total to 2,573.

Children across the province will be heading back for the final few weeks of the academic year, as B.C. schools reopen. Families can decide if they want their children to go to class or to continue learning from home. About 5,000 students, including the children of essential workers and those needing extra support, are already in classrooms across the province. Also Monday, B.C.'s minimum wage jumps by 75 cents to $14.60 an hour. The increase is part of the government's plan to bring in a $15-per-hour minimum wage by 2021 and, though scheduled years before the pandemic, comes at a perilous time for workers and business owners alike. Economists say the rise could be the final blow for businesses struggling to survive the spring, but is also desperately needed for low-wage workers already stretched thin in a province where the cost of living is high. For both groups, Monday also brings the next round of rent due. On Monday, Finance Minister Carole James made a new order to protect small businesses from eviction if they are unable to make rent. James said landlords who are eligible but choose not to apply for the federal Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program will not be able to evict their business tenants for unpaid rent. The federal program is meant to lower rent owed by small business tenants by 75 per cent for April, May and June. In Metro Vancouver, TransLink will begin charging passengers for bus fares again on Monday. Buses will start running at up to two-thirds capacity, still avoiding full capacity to prevent crowding.  TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond said masks are not mandatory on public transit, but ""strongly"" encouraged. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said passengers should ride at off-peak times if they are unable to wear a mask. Nationally, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the federal government will be fast-tracking $2.2 billion in expected infrastructure funding to Canadian cities as they, too, struggle with cashflow. Such payments are made to more than 3,600 communities in two instalments per year, but Trudeau said Monday the money is being sent in one shot now. The $2.2 billion is much less than municipalities say they need. Vancouver alone had asked for a $200-million grant to help its grim financial outlook. The new month has begun with encouraging numbers regarding the spread of COVID-19 in B.C. Last week saw the lowest number of deaths and new cases since the province declared a public health emergency in March, but on Monday, Henry still advised caution. ""There continues to be some circulation [of COVID-19], particularly in the Lower Mainland,"" said Henry. ""We still need to be vigilant. We still need to be cautious."" There were 24 new cases of the illness since Saturday, bringing the province's total to 2,597. There was one death in the past 48 hours, in a long-term care home in the Fraser Health Authority.  There are 224 active cases throughout the province. Thirty-two people are in hospital, five of them in acute care.  The next health update will be at 3 p.m. PT Tuesday.

Henry, in her regular update with Health Minister Adrian Dix also had no new deaths to report. ""It's always a good day when we can announce that there are no new deaths,"" Dix said. Henry announced that the outbreak at Abbotsford Regional Hospital had been declared over along with several more at long-term care facilities. That leaves B.C. with eight active outbreaks in long-term care. There were two new community outbreaks declared in the Fraser Health Region, at office workplaces. Henry said the outbreaks are small and were detected early. ""This is a testament to how people are being very careful and vigilant,"" Henry said. She said Fraser Health is investigating those outbreaks. The province said about one-third of B.C.'s students — almost 60,000 in all — returned to classrooms Monday as kindergarten to Grade 12 schooling resumed on a part-time and optional basis. Education Minister Rob Fleming said the partial return will allow staff to prepare for a new school year in the fall, and they will spend summer fine tuning how it will work. Given the potential of a second wave of COVID-19, Fleming says it's not unlikely that a hybrid of in-class and online learning will be part of the next school year. He says guidelines limiting class capacity won't change and there are response plans in place in case of a COVID-19 outbreak. The province said Grade 6 students returned at 48.3 per cent of expected enrolment, the highest of all the grades. Grade 12 students returned at the lowest end at 14.5 per cent of expected enrolment. UPDATE: 1/3 of BC students (60,000) have returned to the classroom, along with about 90% of teachers.

On Monday, Health Minister Adrian Dix said he's seen mostly positive signs since Phase 2 of the province's pandemic response began May 19, with British Columbians continuing their commitment to physical distancing. ""People, at least in our neighbourhood, have been very thoughtful and very caring,"" the Vancouver MLA said. But he and Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry also reminded members of the public that the novel coronavirus is still spreading through communities. They urged those participating in protests, such as the one recently against racism and police violence, to take precautions to protect those around them by wearing masks, keeping a physical distance and monitoring for symptoms after the event. As of Tuesday, B.C. has had 2,601 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 165 people who have died. There are currently 207 active cases across the province. A total of 31 people are in hospital, including eight in intensive care.

The province has seen 2,623 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, including 166 people who have died. There are now 214 people with active cases COVID-19, of whom 32 are in hospital, including seven in intensive care. In a written statement announcing the latest numbers, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix addressed ongoing demonstrations against racism and police violence, and said it's important to remember to keep a physical distance of at least two metres from others even during protests. ""Racialized communities face obstacles that others to do not, and we have seen British Columbians proudly stand up and speak out against racism,"" Henry and Dix said. ""Exercising our right to peaceful demonstration is extremely important, and equally important is keeping our communities, loved ones and friends safe during this pandemic."" A ban on gatherings of more than 50 people remains in place across the province. Meanwhile, B.C. continues to make progress on ending COVID-19 outbreaks in hospitals and long-term care homes, with five outbreaks declared over on Tuesday, and two more on Wednesday. That leaves six long-term care homes or assisted living facilities with active outbreaks. The outbreaks that have ended this week include one at an intensive care unit at Abbotsford Regional Hospital, where 10 health-care workers became infected with the novel coronavirus. On Tuesday, however, two new community outbreaks were detected in office settings at New World Technologies and Maersk Distribution Canada, both located in the Fraser Health region. Both workplaces have two confirmed cases of the disease.

There were no new deaths reported. So far, B.C. has detected 2,632 cases of COVID-19 — 2,265 people have recovered and 166 people have died of the disease. There are 201 active cases of COVID-19 in B.C. Twenty-six people are in hospital, six of whom are in intensive care. All of the people in hospital are in the Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal Health regions. Henry said of Thursday's nine cases, four were ""epidemiologically linked"" to patients who had tested positive. They were close to known cases and had shown symptoms but may not have had access to testing at the time. She said all four of those people have now recovered. British Columbians were shown new epidemiological models Thursday showing details of how the pandemic grew in this province and more precisely where cases have been detected. Nationally, the federal government said its data shows the number of cases is dropping. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a new modelling report released later Thursday will show many communities are seeing very low numbers of new cases, most of which can be traced, but warned the country still has a long way to go in its fight against the virus. ""I want to be very clear: We are not out of the woods,"" Trudeau said Thursday morning. The number of active outbreaks of the disease in health-care settings in B.C. continues to fall. On Wednesday, there were six ongoing outbreaks in long-term care homes or assisted living facilities. Meanwhile, health officials are reminding British Columbians that the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people remains in place. For those planning to participate in protests against racism and police brutality, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has recommended keeping a safe physical distance from others and wearing a non-medical mask. A number of municipalities, including Port Coquitlam and Port Moody, are moving to open spray parks, outdoor pools, outdoor summer camps and events as restrictions ease. A statement Thursday said Port Coquitlam is opening spray parks on June 15 and outdoor pools by July 2. Both Port Coquitlam and Port Moody said staff are planning modified outdoor day camps for children over the summer. A public health order from Henry has banned overnight camps in B.C. during the pandemic.

The latest numbers from the province show there are no new community outbreaks, and an outbreak at North Vancouver's Berkley Care Centre is now over.  The province says recent modelling shows it is safe to reopen many businesses, return to school classrooms, and gradually increase social interactions. However, British Columbians are being asked to remain vigilant. ""We have to be cautious that we don't go too far and risk a resurgence in cases,"" said Friday's statement from Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix. Statistics Canada reported a record-high unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent on Friday. The numbers come even as the national economy added 289,600 jobs in May, with several provinces beginning to reopen their economies after months of slowdown. The rate for the month of May beats the previous high of 13.1 per cent set during the recession in December 1982 B.C.'s provincial unemployment rate rose to 13.4 per cent, according to the agency. Finance Minister Carole James said the province has lost more than 353,000 jobs since the pandemic began, with young people being the most affected. BC Ferries announced Friday it will begin increasing service on routes to the Southern Gulf Islands as demand is revived. A statement said direct sailings from Tsawwassen to the Southern Gulf Islands will resume on June 9, including the reopening of the Long Harbour terminal on Salt Spring Island.  Regular service between the Saanich Peninsula (Brentwood Bay) and Vancouver Island (Mill Bay) will resume June 24. The corporation said the ferries will continue to operate at off-peak service levels for northern and mid-coast communities. It said it will monitor demand on bigger runs linking the Lower Mainland to Nanaimo and Victoria to increase service as needed. The latest modelling from the B.C. government shows that despite the gradual reopening of the province over the last few weeks, British Columbians have been cautious about renewing their physical connections and infection rates have stayed low. ""Moving forward, our approach is to 'minimize, manage and modify': minimize the number of new cases, manage cases and clusters with rapid contact tracing, and modify our measures as needed,"" Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint statement on Thursday. The latest numbers suggest people are still limiting their social contacts to between 30 and 40 per cent of what they were before the pandemic, while B.C.'s infection and death rates remain lower than most other provinces. So far B.C. has confirmed 2,632 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 167 people who have died. There are now 193 patients with active patients of the novel coronavirus in the province, of whom 21 are in hospital, including five in intensive care. Strains traced to Europe and Eastern Canada are by far the largest source of COVID-19 infections in B.C., according to the new modelling released Thursday.

Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix provided their first COVID-19 update in three days on Monday afternoon. They took the weekend off from regular news conferences. As of Monday afternoon, B.C. had 183 active cases of COVID-19. There are now 16 people in hospital with the disease, four of whom are in intensive care. B.C. has detected 2,659 cases so far and 2,309 people have recovered. There are four active outbreaks in long-term care homes, while community outbreaks at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry and Superior Poultry have been declared over. The province says Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix will now only do broadcast briefings on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays of each week.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced an exemption to the Canada-U.S. border shutdown to allow immediate family members of Canadian citizens or permanent residents to visit from the U.S. The exemption includes spouses, children, parents or guardians. Visitors to Canada will have to quarantine for 14 days and plan to stay in the country for at least 15 days, the prime minister said Monday. The border was closed to all non-essential visitors in mid-March. Also on Monday, BC Ferries said, as of June 15 in order to travel, all passengers will be required to bring a face mask that covers their mouth and nose. The rule applies for routes longer than 30 minutes for all passengers over the age of two, including people travelling by car. Passengers who don't have a mask will not be allowed to board. The statement from the ferry corporation said customers must bring their own masks as the corporation will not be handing them out. The Chinese community's early efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus in B.C. appear to have paid off, despite some of its members being stigmatized because of the virus, according to infectious disease doctors. The province released data last week showing Richmond, B.C. — the city with the highest concentration of Chinese residents in the province — has had the lowest percentage of cases on the Lower Mainland, home to the bulk of B.C.'s cases. There have also been no new active cases in Richmond since May 18. It's the only part of the Lower Mainland where that is the case. ""Whether that is a direct impact of early distancing and early aggressive manoeuvres on behalf of the [Chinese] community, it's impossible to say, but clearly there is an association there,"" said Dr. Srinivas Murthy, co-chair of the World Health Organization's clinical research committee on COVID-19. UBC infectious diseases specialist Dr. Peter Phillips agreed the ""evidence is pretty clear"" that the community ""showed great leadership"" in the early fight against the virus. The Ministry of Education said more than 157,000 kindergarten to Grade 12 students — or nearly 30 per cent of all students in those grades — went back to school after classrooms opened again on a voluntary basis last week. The last day of school for students is June 25. Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver will start a phased reopening on June 22. The mountain said it will start welcoming annual passholders and guests who need a download after hiking the Grouse Grind, which reopens the same day.  The Central City Fun Park in Surrey reopened on Sunday. Guests to both the mountain and the amusement park will need to wear masks and there are limits on the number of people permitted at each location.

""We are still seeing cases. We are moving slowly,"" Dix said.

On Wednesday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix reported 12 new cases of COVID-19 were detected in B.C. As of Wednesday, there are 185 active cases of COVID-19 in the province. Twelve people are in hospital and four of them are in intensive care. Since the pandemic began, B.C. has detected 2,680 cases in the province. 2,328 people who tested positive have recovered. A total of 167 British Columbians have died. Officials announced a new long-term care home outbreak at Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver. Five long-term care or assisted-living facilities in the province have active outbreaks. Premier John Horgan said the Vancouver Canucks' plan to host National Hockey League games in the city has the approval of his government and Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. Horgan said the plan involves a modification to quarantine requirements in B.C. allowing a team to be considered a family entity or a ""bubble."" The team and its personnel would stay together in one hotel and travel to and from the rink together in private transportation. Testing would be the responsibility of the teams and no interaction with the public would be allowed for the 14-day quarantine. ""It's only expanding the number of people within the bubble that would allow the NHL teams to come to Vancouver,"" Horgan said Wednesday at a media availability in Victoria. Horgan also made an announcement for minor sports Wednesday: his government, he said, passed an order shielding minor sports organizations, officials and volunteers from legal liability as a result of COVID-19. Horgan said the announcement would help encourage people to get outside and be active. He said many of these organizations have heard from insurers that they would not get insurance for COVID-19-related liability during the pandemic. Minor sport organizations, he said, will have to follow public health directives. Horgan also announced that B.C.'s state of emergency would be extended for another two weeks. Under B.C. law, states of emergency can only be in place for two weeks at a time. Henry said Tuesday it's important to remain cautious while transmission is still increasing globally. ""The global case count continues to rise and many regions are facing a resurgence in cases. Just yesterday was the highest single day for new cases globally. This is concerning for all of us,"" the provincial health officer said Tuesday. ""We need to watch closely what is happening globally and in B.C., and we need to do all we can to protect our communities and our province."" As the province continues to reopen, more and more people are back on public transit. TransLink on Wednesday said its system-wide boardings were 85 per cent higher last week than they were during the second week of April, which had the lowest ridership levels of the pandemic. There were 2,578,000 boardings from May 31 to June 6, compared to 1,396,000 between April 5 and 11. The majority of those passengers were on buses. ICBC is also resuming its commercial road tests for Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 licences. The tests will be starting again on June 11 by appointment only.

The loss of life, which passes the total number of British Columbians killed by COVID-19, evoked strong emotions from the province's top doctor. ""I cannot express how difficult this news has been to hear"" said Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, who extended her condolences to the family and friends of those killed. ""I share your grief. These are our brothers and sisters, our co-workers, our sons, our daughters, our community."" Dr. Henry echoed the Coroners Service analysis, saying the deaths stem largely from increased toxicity of street drugs in B.C. However, she also addressed the influence of social distancing measures used to combat COVID-19 which have caused more people to use alone. ""We are not only seeing people die in the Downtown Eastside,"" she said. ""This is the case across B.C."" B.C. restaurants, meanwhile, can now operate above 50 per cent capacity. The change comes after Dr. Henry revised a public health order concerning eateries late Wednesday. Individual restaurants must identify how many patrons and staff their site can accommodate, both inside and on patios, while maintaining two metres of distance. The number must be included in the restaurants' safety plan, which must be posted for patrons to see. The update also clarifies restrictions on the use of barriers and adds restrictions for self-serve areas and buffets, such as increased signage reminding patrons to wash their hand and frequent cleaning of high touch surfaces and utensils. Dr. Henry also threw her support behind Vancouver's proposal to become an NHL hub city, albeit with strict rules. ""In no way will we compromise all the work that we have done and the health of British Columbians for the NHL"" she said. The proposal, which could see players arriving in Vancouver for spectator-less games in late summer or early fall, includes requirements barring teams from having public contact, as well as contact with their families. Dr. Henry says teams would exist in small bubbles of less than 50 people and would be subject to screening and testing for the duration of their stay in Vancouver. To date, B.C. has confirmed 2,694 cases of COVID-19, of which 183 are still active. Thirteen people were in the hospital with the virus on Thursday afternoon, including five in intensive care. As of Thursday, 167 people have died from the novel coronavirus in B.C.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry provided a statement Friday afternoon outlining the new numbers, which included 16 new cases. ""We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" she said in a release. Despite the new death, B.C. is easing up on restrictions for places like restaurants as the curve of COVID-19 infection continues to flatten. On Thursday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said operators will no longer be limited to serving 50 per cent of their normal capacity. A total of 168 people have died from COVID-19 in the province, while there have been 2,709 confirmed cases. 12 people are in hospital with the virus, including three in intensive care. While B.C. has had some success keeping the virus under control, the province's other public health emergency is only getting worse, four years in. May 2020 was the worst month on record for suspected drug overdose deaths, with 170 — more people than the number who have died in the entire COVID-19 pandemic.  READ MORE: Important reminders: Health officials widely agree the most important thing you can do to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  The World Health Organization said more than 80 per cent of COVID-19 infections are estimated to be mild.

A total of 36 cases have been confirmed in the same period, for a total of 2,745 to date. Of those cases, 168 people have died and 182 are still active. As of Monday, 13 people are in hospital, including four in intensive care. Henry is reminding British Columbians the COVID-19 pandemic is not over and precautions must still be taken — new cases are still arising and the virus will continue to live in communities for months to come, she said B.C. remains in Phase 2 of its reopening plan and the shift into the next phase will be gradual, Henry said.   ""In many parts of our province where we haven't had new cases in a long time. It might feel like we're back to normal,"" Henry said Monday. ""It is easy sometimes when we're in the place that we're in, to think the pandemic is over."" Last week, Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said they have been closely monitoring infections as the province rolls out COVID-19 restart plans, which have allowed an array of restaurants and personal service establishments to reopen. They said newly enhanced guidance for restaurants and pubs is also available from WorkSafeBC to adjust for small clusters of new cases as employees spend more time together. The province also said a safe number of patrons is highly dependent on the amount of space within each location, not the restaurant capacity. On Thursday Henry said operators will no longer be limited to serving 50 per cent of their normal capacity. Group gatherings remain limited to a maximum of 50 people with room for physical distancing and this will remain a reality in the months to come, Dix added.   B.C. has seen several anti-racism protests in the past two weeks with crowds in the thousands. Asked about the health impacts, Henry said it's important that people be able to speak out against racism in this way, even during a pandemic. However, attendees should try to physically distance from one another and wear masks, she said.  As cases wane, the Ministry of Health has pulled back on briefings from Henry and Dix. They are now happening on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays of each week. The ministry has been releasing a statement update on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Updates have not been provided on weekends.

Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the federal government is extending the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) by another eight weeks. The $2,000-per-month benefit was originally set to last 16 weeks, starting in mid-March, meaning that people who signed up for it immediately would soon run out. Trudeau also said the Canada-U.S. border closure will be extended by another 30 days so it remains in place until late July.  In B.C., health officials say the transition into the next phase of the province's COVID-19 pandemic response will be gradual to make sure transmission doesn't spike. During her daily briefing on Monday, Henry said precautions must still be taken because the virus will continue to circulate in communities for months to come.

B.C. health officials say, in total, 2,822 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in B.C. and 169 people have died. However, 2,471 people have recovered from their illness. Fourteen patients were being treated in hospital for COVID-19, including six in intensive care. While the numbers in British Columbia continue to be encouraging, Canada passed a grim milestone on Thursday, when the number of confirmed and presumptive cases across the country surpassed 100,000. Henry said the province must proceed with caution as it continues the gradual process of reopening, which includes the easing of restrictions on non-essential travel. The province has announced a new round of funding for children with special needs and youth aging out of care to maintain supports through summer as the pandemic continues. A statement said a final round of the short-term Emergency Relief Support fund for children and youth with special needs and their families will be available from July 1 to Sept. 30, offering $225 per month for up to three months for eligible families. The fund was previously set to run out on June 30. The following supports were also extended: The latter measure means youth living in foster care, contracted residential agencies or with relatives ""are able to stay where they are,"" the Ministry of Children and Family Development said in a statement Monday. The Vancouver Park Board announced Monday it will be opening four outdoor pools, 10 spray parks, and staffing nine Vancouver beaches with lifeguards for the summer. Visitors will need to book time slots in the pools to avoid overcrowding, the board said, and arrive in their bathing suits as change rooms will stay closed. Vancouver's Stanley Park reopens to vehicle traffic on Monday, though cars will only be able to use one lane of the roadway instead of two, as was the case before the pandemic. The other lane is now a designated bike lane. The Grouse Grind in North Vancouver also reopens Monday, with physical distancing precautions in place.

As well, there has been one additional death. Henry also revealed that the latest round of epidemiological modelling shows contacts in B.C. are now at 65 per cent of normal, which is near the threshold for a potential rebound in new cases. Previously, the province said it could go up to 60 per cent of normal contact rates while keeping a lid on the number of new cases. B.C. is currently maintaining a fine balance when it comes to increasing the number of connections without seeing a dramatic increase in the number of people becoming infected, says Henry. People with loved ones living in long-term care homes in B.C. could be allowed to visit at some point in the next few weeks.

The latest guidelines allow B.C. residents to travel responsibly within the province and for many tourism-related businesses to reopen under the guidance of the provincial health officer and WorkSafeBC, including hotels, resorts, spas and RV parks. The film industry and select entertainment venues, such as movie theatres, are also getting the go ahead. As the province moves ahead with its Phase 3 restart, officials are reminding the public that the risk of infection still persists. Residents are asked to maintain their COVID-19 health practices, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and wearing a mask when distancing isn't possible.  Horgan also reminded the public to keep their social circles small, saying this summer is not the time for ""large family gatherings and big parties."" ""Although we are going to have a summer that's better than what we thought a few months ago, this is not a return to normal."" said the premier. Horgan also acknowledged that several First Nations communities, including the Heiltsuk, Haida, Nuxalk, and Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, have expressed concern about travellers, and that some communities are not prepared to accept tourists. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, meanwhile, warned that B.C. could see a ""rapid rebound"" in COVID-19 cases, if residents were to get complacent. ""We've been doing it over the last few months and we've been doing it well in British Columbia.⁠ We need to keep that up"" she said. B.C.'s Housing Ministry is once again allowing landlords to evict tenants for reasons other than late payment, or non-payment of rent. The province issued a moratorium on evictions on March 30, to protect British Columbians from being evicted amidst the COVID-19 emergency. Many of those laws, however, are now back in effect. Landlords can evict tenants for reasons other than unpaid or late rent — subletting without permission, for instance — and may once again enter a rental suite with 24-hours notice,even without the tenant's consent. They are, however, expected to follow health and safety guidelines such as physical distancing, and wearing a mask. Existing eviction orders are also back in play. The province says landlords may take the orders to court for enforcement starting July 2. Rent increases, however, are still suspended, as are evictions for non-payment of rent. The province says it plans to give people plenty of notice before lifting these restrictions and wants to install a framework that would require landlords to cooperate with tenants on rent repayment.

She says 170 of those cases are still considered active. There are currently 15 people in hospital, seven of whom are in intensive care.  Henry also announced that two more people have died. They were both in long-term care.   A public school teacher in the Fraser Health Region is among the 20 new cases of COVID-19 in B.C. announced Thursday, said Henry. ""We anticipated and planned for this potential,"" she said, noting that health officials are monitoring the situation very closely. All the teacher's contacts have been notified and none of the students have been exposed, she said.  The province extended temporary layoff times Thursday to a maximum of 24 weeks, expiring Aug. 30. Until recently, any layoffs longer than 13 weeks in any 20-week period were considered to be permanent and the employer would have to provide a notice of termination and pay any required severance. On May 4, the government extended this period to 16 weeks if the employer and employee could come to an agreement. In a statement, the Ministry of Labour said Thursday's extension will align with the extended federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit. ""This extension will provide even more certainty and flexibility,"" Minister of Labour Harry Bains said in a statement. ""This will also give additional time to ensure that employers and workers are able to craft agreements if there is a need to further extend temporary layoffs, while still protecting workers' rights to compensation for length of service."" The opposition Liberals had called for the temporary layoff provisions to be extended once the legislature returned, to save jobs and help businesses facing severance costs. B.C.'s Ministry of Education said schools learned a few lessons of their own in June when students returned to classes on a largely part-time basis. In a statement, the ministry said those experiences will help shape what the next school year, beginning in September, will look like. A steering committee of teachers, parents, First Nations, support staff, principals and vice-principals, school boards and trustees and public health representatives will discuss best practices and find solutions to problems, the ministry said. The ministry says the hope is to increase the number of students attending classes safely, using a five-stage approach informed by health guidelines, ""allowing schools to respond quickly in the event of a second wave."" The ministry said the June restart saw almost 200,000 students return to classrooms. B.C.

Friday and one more death connected to the disease. The person who died was in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Their death brings the number of British Columbians who have died of the disease since the pandemic began to 174. ""We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Henry and Dix said in a statement. B.C. has confirmed 2,878 cases of COVID-19 to date. That number includes a one-case data correction from Thursday. Of those 2,878 pepole, 2,545 have recovered and 159 still have active cases. As of Friday, 17 people were in hospital with the disease including five in intensive care. No new outbreaks were reported Friday in the community or in the health-care system. The outbreak at Nicola Lodge in Port Coquitlam was declared over Friday. That leaves B.C. with five long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility with active outbreaks. There are two remaining community outbreaks. First Nations across B.C. have been able to limit the number of COVID-19 cases in their communities by strictly following health guidelines and taking quick action to protect their territories, data revealed Friday shows. Dr. Shannon McDonald of the First Nations Health Authority said there have been 87 cases of the virus among Indigenous people in B.C. between Jan. 1 and June 14, and four deaths — a rate below the provincial average. McDonald credited the success to the many sacrifices made by First Nations communities to follow health restrictions and restrict travel, including the willingness to cancel cultural and family gatherings integral to Indigenous culture. The presentation was originally slated for last Friday, but was abruptly cancelled. B.C. Health Minster Adrian Dix instead held an impromptu news conference, where he announced the province is investigating allegations that health-care staff in emergency rooms played a ""game"" to guess the blood-alcohol level of Indigenous patients. Officials have described the behaviour as an overt example of widespread, deep-rooted racism in health care. The government has appointed Mary-Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge and longtime children's advocate in B.C., to investigate the claims and make recommendations to the province. Henry announced 20 new confirmed cases on Thursday, including a public school teacher in the Fraser Health region. Henry said the teacher was exposed through a social interaction and linked to a known case. All the teacher's contacts have been notified and no students have been exposed, she said. It's the second COVID-19 case linked to schools since the province resumed in-class instruction June 1. ""We anticipated and planned for this potential,"" Henry said, noting that health officials are monitoring the situation very closely. Vancouver is out of the running as a hub for the NHL's return. The Vancouver Canucks confirmed the decision in a tweet on Thursday. It means Toronto and Edmonton are the lone Canadian cities remaining in contention to host the NHL's Stanley Cup tournament. Under B.C.'s plan, a team would have stayed in one hotel and travelled together to Rogers Arena for games using private transportation. Each team would also be responsible for any COVID-19 testing and agree not to interact with the public during a 14-day isolation period. Premier John Horgan said he was disappointed by the news, but wouldn't bend public health rules for the NHL. Dr. Henry echoed those sentiments at a news conference before the team made its announcement, saying public health was her main focus. Henry said her direction to the hockey league was that if positive cases arose, it could mean suspending part of the series. Dix told a news conference that B.C.'s hard line on rules to protect people from getting the novel coronavirus is the reason Vancouver should be a hub city. He said he supported the idea of hockey being played again in Vancouver, but as minister of health he noted the rules that have contained the spread of COVID-19 apply to all. The province extended temporary layoff times Thursday to a maximum of 24 weeks, expiring Aug. 30. Until recently, any layoffs longer than 13 weeks in any 20-week period were considered to be permanent and the employer would have to provide a notice of termination and pay any required severance.

Henry said it should serve as a reminder that the virus is still circulating in B.C., and everyone needs to stay vigilant. ""It is a team effort that we need to continue together in B.C.,"" she said. Right now, there are 153 active cases of the virus in B.C. Eighteen people are in hospital, including five in intensive care. The province has moved to a new stage of its COVID-19 recovery, with Premier John Horgan announcing the move to Phase 3 last week. It means residents are allowed to travel within the province as hotels, motels, resorts, spas, and RV parks look to reopen. On Monday, Health Minister Adrian Dix said that the opportunity to travel for vacation shouldn't be taken as a holiday from physical distancing and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. He also urged anyone who is feeling ill to stay at home. The film industry and select entertainment venues, such as movie theatres, have also received the go-ahead to resume business.  As the province moves ahead, officials are reminding the public that the risk of infection remains. Officials though are confident about entering Phase 3 as B.C. had reduced positive cases to such a low point before opening things up.   B.C. has five long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility with active outbreaks.  Residents are asked to maintain their COVID-19 health practices, including physical distancing, frequent handwashing and wearing a mask when distancing isn't possible.  Horgan also reminded the public to keep social circles small, saying this summer is not the time for ""large family gatherings and big parties."" ""Although we are going to have a summer that's better than what we thought a few months ago, this is not a return to normal,"" the premier said Wednesday at a news conference.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said restrictions banning non-essential family visits to prevent the spread of COVID-19 will now be eased, allowing one designated person to see loved ones in care. Henry said visits will have to be scheduled in advance and visitors will have to wear a mask. She added the designation could be expanded to allow more visitors in the future, but she wants to start slowly. Tuesday afternoon, health officials announced another 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19, but said no new deaths have been recorded. A total of 2,916 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in B.C. to date, including 174 people who have died. There are 152 active cases of the virus in B.C. Eighteen people are in hospital, including four in intensive care. After multiple people were exposed to COVID-19 at a Vancouver strip club, Henry has warned that British Columbians need to remain vigilant or risk all the progress the province has made on flattening the curve of infection. Three cases of the novel coronavirus have now been linked to exposure at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge, the provincial health officer said on Monday. Henry said business owners need to be aware of the risks of infection right now and do everything they can to keep employees and customers safe.

The Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver claimed to hold the only Canada Day parade in the country with a drive-thru tour of the grounds featuring food and special performances.  Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sent a special message to B.C.'s health-care workers to thank them for their dedication and hard work.  A total of 2,940 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in B.C. to date, including 177 people who have died. There are 160 active cases of the virus in the province. Seventeen people are in hospital, including two in intensive care.

In the three days since Friday, nine people tested positive between Friday and Saturday, 15 between Saturday and Sunday and seven between Sunday and Monday. Health Minister Adrian Dix says all six deaths occurred in long-term care facilities. ""To lose 6 people, all in long-term care, is a source of enormous grief for the families involved and the community involved."" Of the 166 active cases of the virus in B.C., 16 people are being treated in hospitals, including four in intensive care units. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said as the province has transitioned to Phase 3 of its reopening, more people have been increasing social contacts. She says while it's important to remain cautious and follow public health rules, people should not rush to judgment about visitors to B.C. who are required to quarantine for 14 days. ""We need to show understanding. Let's assume the best, rather than offering judgment."" Dix also gave an update on plans to reinstate visits at long-term care facilities saying that visitations could start at some facilities as early as next week. He expects the majority of operators will submit plans for visitations this week. The province said Monday it is extending benefits for low-income seniors and those on disability and income assistance. The previously announced program adds a monthly benefit of $300 to assistance cheques as part of the provincial government's $5-billion COVID-19 financial aid plan. The program was set to end in June but will now continue through Aug. 26. The province will be providing an exemption to clawbacks on federal employment insurance benefits for the next three months, including the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). The exemption will now last as long as the federal benefits do. Over the weekend, more deaths were announced at a long-term care facility in Vancouver. Officials with Providence Health Care said three more residents have died at Holy Family Hospital, bringing the total number of deaths at the facility to eight since the pandemic began. The COVID-19 outbreak at Holy Family was announced on June 9. To date, 42 residents and 24 staff have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Holy Family Hospital is one of three long-term care or assisted-living facilities currently dealing with active COVID-19 outbreaks. There is also an outbreak at one acute care facility. Friday, Henry announced 162 active cases in the province, with a total of 2,947 positive cases since the pandemic began.
